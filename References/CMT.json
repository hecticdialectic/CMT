However, previous studies have not provided good empirical information on the iconicity of specific characters. To fill this gap, 40 U.S. adults with no knowledge of Chinese were given an English word or short phrase together with two Chinese characters and were asked which character matched the meaning of the English word. The right and wrong answers had the same number of strokes, and different wrong answers were used for different participants. We examined all 213 simple-structure Chinese characters that occur in textbooks for elementary school children. The overall percentage of correct responses was 53.6%, slightly but significantly higher than would be expected by chance. Using a false discovery rate procedure, we found that 15 of the 213 characters were guessed at a level higher than chance. The proportion of correct responses to each character, which can be taken as an indicator of its degree of iconicity, should be useful to researchers studying Chinese character reading and writing.

The present study was conducted in order to examine the relationship between pure tone frequencies and geometric figures. A pure tone oscillator was constructed which produced tones in a continuous sweep from 40–12,250 Hz. Six geometric shapes were employed and varied along three binary dimensions (size, complexity, and density) producing a total of 48 stimulus figures. Twelve male and twelve female subjects adjusted pure tone frequencies until they “best fit” the visually presented geometric figure in a complete within-subject, block-randomization design of 48 trials. There was consistency in the assignment of pure tone frequencies to the dimensions of the geometric figures. Round figures (circles and ellipses) generally received lower frequency assignments than other figures, and the shape by size interaction was also found to be statistically significant. The results are interpreted in light of recent research in psycholinguistics and in particular to the hypothesis of a “universal phonetic symbolism.”","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01068115","DOI":"10.1007/BF01068115","author":[{"family":"O'Boyle","given":"Michael W."},{"family":"Tarte","given":"Robert D."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1980,11,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2009",3,3]]},"title-short":"Implications for phonetic symbolism"},

Pairs of names of birds & fish in Huambisa were presented to Ss (N = approximately 600 undergraduates) to match them with words for familiar concepts in English. Results indicate that Ss had a 58% accuracy rate in correctly identifying bird & fish names. It is concluded that the phonetic characteristics of the names of fish & birds in Huambisa indicate universal sound-symbolic processes. Birds & fish differ based on the distribution of phonetic segments of high & low acoustic frequency. Bird names have a greater number of segments of high frequency to connote rapid motions, whereas fish names have lower-frequency segments to connote smooth, slow, continuous flow. Bird & fish nomenclature demonstrate a prominent internal pattern of size-sound symbolism where vowel quality & relative size are associated at high levels of statistical significance. The data suggest that the Huambisa are unconsciously motivated to develop systems of zoological nomenclature whose sound-meaning associations take full advantage of the frequency code innate to many living species. 9 Tables, 22 References.

By examining secondary iconicity in sensory vocabulary, this study draws attention to diagrammatic qualities in human interaction with, and representation of, the sensory world. In Semai (Mon-Khmer, Aslian), spoken on Peninsular Malaysia, sensory experiences are encoded by expressives. Expressives display a diagrammatic iconic structure whereby related sensory experiences receive related linguistic forms. Through this type of form-meaning mapping, gradient relationships in the perceptual world receive gradient linguistic representations. Form-meaning mapping such as this enables speakers to categorize sensory events into types and subtypes of perceptions, and provide sensory specifics of various kinds. This study illustrates how a diagrammatic iconic structure within sensory vocabulary creates networks of relational sensory knowledge. Through analogy, speakers draw on this knowledge to comprehend sensory referents and create new unconventional forms, which are easily understood by other members of the community. Analogy-making such as this allows speakers to capture fine-grained differences between sensory events, and effectively guide each other through the Semai sensory landscape.","DOI":"10.2752/174589311X12893982233876","author":[{"family":"Tufvesson","given":"Sylvia"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]}},

Thus, in a broad sense we could say that synesthesia takes place when ordinary stimuli elicit extraordinary conscious experiences.

Experiment 1 shows that synaesthetes choose more precise colours and are more internally consistent in their choice of colours given a set of sounds of varying pitch, timbre and composition (single notes or dyads) relative to a group of controls. In spite of this difference, both controls and synaesthetes appear to use the same heuristics for matching between auditory and visual domains (e.g., pitch to lightness). We take this as evidence that synaesthesia may recruit some of the mechanisms used in normal cross-modal perception. Experiment 2 establishes that synaesthetic colours are automatically elicited insofar as they give rise to cross-modal Stroop interference. Experiment 3 uses a variant of the cross-modal Posner paradigm in which detection of a lateralised target is enhanced when combined with a non-informative but synaesthetically congruent sound-colour pairing. This suggests that synaesthesia uses the same (or an analogous) mechanism of exogenous cross-modal orienting as normal perception. Overall, the results support the conclusion that this form of synaesthesia recruits some of the same mechanisms used in normal cross-modal perception rather than using direct, privileged pathways between unimodal auditory and unimodal visual areas that are absent in most other adults.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B8JH1-4S03J1G-K/1/2d02b92d34636af67db065100a4b6070","DOI":"10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70352-6","author":[{"family":"Ward","given":"Jamie"},{"family":"Huckstep","given":"Brett"},{"family":"Tsakanikos","given":"Elias"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",6,8]]},"title-short":"Sound-Colour Synaesthesia"},

Importantly, synesthesia is evoked also in the absence of direct sensory stimulation, i.e., the proprioceptive inputs during swimming. To evoke synesthetic colors, it is sufficient to evoke the concept of a given swimming style e.g., by showing a photograph of a swimming person. A color-consistency test and a Stroop-type test indicated that the synesthesia is genuine.

These associations are acquired in early childhood and remain robust throughout the lifetime. Synesthetic associations can transfer to novel inducers in adulthood as one learns a second language that uses another writing system. However, it is not known how long this transfer takes. We found that grapheme-color associations can transfer to novel graphemes after only a 10-minute writing exercise. Most subjects experienced synesthetic associations immediately after learning a new Glagolitic grapheme. Using a Stroop task, we provide objective evidence for the creation of novel associations between the newly learned graphemes and synesthetic colors. Also, these associations generalized to graphemes handwritten by another person. The fast learning process and the generalization suggest that synesthesia begins at the semantic level of representation with the activation of a certain concept (the inducer), which then, uniquely for the synesthetes, activates representations at the perceptual level (the concurrent). Thus, the results imply that synesthesia is a much more flexible and plastic phenomenon than has been believed until now.","URL":"http://www.journalofvision.org/content/9/12/25.abstract","DOI":"10.1167/9.12.25","author":[{"family":"Mroczko","given":"Aleksandra"},{"family":"Metzinger","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Singer","given":"Wolf"},{"family":"Nikolić","given":"Danko"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,11,30]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",6,23]]}},

Sixty-five participants selected their preferred sound to accompany each of the basic tastes of sweet, sour, bitter, and salty, at two different concentrations.

We also found a preference for mapping certain sound qualities to different taste concentrations.

Most common is the linkage of letters and digits (graphemes) to colors. Whereas synaesthesia might be partly genetically determined, the linkages to specific colors are assumed to be learned. We present a systematic statistical analysis of synaesthetic color perception based on subjects' reproduction of individual colors for each grapheme, instead of simple verbal categorizations. The statistical analysis revealed that the color perceptions, measured with the HSL (hue, saturation, and luminance) scale, varied systematically among the different digits and letters. The frequencies of the digits and letters (in the German language) partly explained these systematic variations. However, digit frequency was more strongly related to color perception in the synaesthetes than was letter frequency. The results for digit and letter frequency indicate that experience with graphemes may shape synaesthetic color perception.","URL":"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/18/9/788.abstract","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01980.x","author":[{"family":"Beeli","given":"Gian"},{"family":"Esslen","given":"Michaela"},{"family":"Jäncke","given":"Lutz"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",7,29]]}},

Recent work on the eye and retinal ganglion cell layer of the platypus is presented that provides an estimate of visual acuity and suggests that platypus ancestors may have used vision, as well as the bill organ, for underwater predation. The combined electroreceptor and mechanoreceptor array in the bill is considered in detail, with special reference to the elaborate cortical structure, where inputs from these two sensory arrays are integrated in a manner that is astonishingly similar to the stripe-like ocular dominance array in primate visual of cortex, that integrates input from the two eyes. A new hypothesis, along with supporting data, is presented for this combined mechanoreceptive-electroreceptive complex in platypus cortex. Bill mechanoreceptors are shown to be capable of detecting mechanical waves travelling through the water from moving prey. These mechanical waves arrive after the electrical activity from the same prey, as a function of distance. Bimodal cortical neurones, sensitive to combined mechanical and electrical stimulation, with a delay, can thus signal directly the absolute distance of the prey. Combined with the directional information provided by signal processing of the thousands of receptors on the bill surface, the stripe-like cortical array enables the platypus to use two different sensory systems in its bill to achieve a complete, three-dimensional 'fix' on its underwater prey.","ISSN":"0962-8436","author":[{"family":"Pettigrew","given":"John D."},{"family":"Manger","given":"Paul R."},{"family":"Fine","given":"S.

In this practice sound and image are tightly linked by a cross-wiring of media signals. Synesthesia is often invoked around such work, proposing a parallel between perceptual and technical cross-wiring. This synesthetic analogy provides a historical context as well as an analytic frame; it is tested here through a reading of relevant neuro- and perceptual science that illustrates some striking parallels. Ultimately, however, an alternative model is proposed based on cross-modal binding, where stimuli in different modalities are “bound” into correlated wholes. Understood as cross-modal objects, transcoded audiovisuals direct us to the signal that underpins both sound and image, as well as to the map, or domain of correlation, between modalities. The wider significance of this practice, it is argued, lies in its ability to provide an aesthetic and affective manifestation of these abstract structures - structures that are central to new media culture, but largely imperceptible.","URL":"http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/berg/tsas/2008/00000003/00000003/art00001","DOI":"10.2752/174589308X331314","author":[{"family":"Whitelaw","given":"Mitchell"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,11]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",7,8]]}},

Owing to a \"mediated association\" with \"thick people and animals [who] are usually loud and resonant\", or owing to some \"subtle inter-sensory quality\" found in thick things and bass voices? The present paper rejects the former possibility and endorses the latter. As to speech-sound symbolism, I account for it with reference to two aspects: phonetic features and precategorial information. I conceive of speech sounds as of bundles of acoustic and articulatory features each of which may have certain (sometimes conflicting) combinational potentials, which may be activated, after the event, by certain meaning components. Speech is transmitted by sound waves; but while speech categories are consciously perceived, the rich precategorial auditory information that transmitted them is excluded from awareness. I assume that intuitions regarding perceptual and emotional qualities of speech sounds are prompted by rich precategorial auditory information that subliminally reaches awareness in spite of all. Examining a sample of 136 languages, Russell Ultan (1978) pointed out that in a wide range of cultures high front vowels are typically perceived as small or denoting small things, whereas low back vowels are typically perceived as big or denoting large things. \"Since high front vowels reflect proportionately higher second formant frequencies, [...] there appears a correspondence between a feature of high frequency (=short wavelength in physical terms) and the category of small size\". Gerard Diffloth (1994) provides a counterexample: There is a word class in a Vietnamese dialect in which \"high is big\", and \"low is small\". Though I sympathise with quite a few of Diffloth's generalisations, I must conclude that he arrives at his contradictory findings by changing the rules of the game. The two researchers mean different things by the same words. Speaking of \"high\" and \"low\", Ultan means relative formant frequency; Diffloth means articulatory location. The \"height\" of the place of articulation of the vowel is in an inverse relation to the frequency of its first formant. \"High\" articulatory location is synonymous with \"low\" first formant frequency. So, in both instances \"high frequency is small\" and \"low frequency is big\". They differ, then, in that while Ultan's intercultural sample directs attention to the frequency of the second formant, Diffloth's Vietnamese word class focusses on the frequency of the first formant. As far as the size-vowel symbolism is concerned, the convincing counterexamples are still to be adduced.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VCW-4J6W74K-1/2/75d36f132b18e86d69a718ec047ebf99","DOI":"10.1016/j.pragma.2005.12.002","author":[{"family":"Tsur","given":"Reuven"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,6]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",4,3]]}},

The study is based on a genealogically stratified sample of 237 languages. The aim is to contribute with an empirical study to the growing dialogue focusing on different forms of lexical iconicity. The conceptual framework of the present study is based on an analysis of types and means of lexical iconicity in the sample languages. Archaeological and cultural evidence are used to tie lexical iconicity to its context.\n\nPhenomena related to lexical iconicity are studied both cross-linguistically and language-specifically. The cognitive difference between imitation and symbolism is essential. Lexical iconicity is not only about the iconic relationship between form and referents, but also about how certain iconic properties may become conventional, means used to create sound symbolism.\n\nAll the sample languages show some evidence of lexical iconicity, demonstrating that it is a universal feature. Nine comparisons of onomatopoeic verbs and nouns, with samples varying between six and 141 languages, show that typologically highly different languages use similar means for creating words based on sound imitation. Two cross-linguistic comparisons of bird names demonstrate that a vast majority of the Eurasian names of the common cuckoo and the world-wide names of crow and raven of the 141 genera are onomatopoeic.","author":[{"family":"Marttila","given":"Annu"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"publisher-place":"Helsinki"},

Foregrounded through distinctive syntactic patterns and prosodic features, they often exhibit a closer relationship between sound and meaning than the remainder of the lexicon. In addition, ideophones are generally expressed by, dependent on, or even entirely replaced by, bodily gesture. Yet, research on African oral narrative often dismisses ideophones as onomatopoeic or untranslatable, while linguistic studies ignore their discourse function, contextualized meanings, and gestural expression.\n\nIn this study, analysis of a single Shona-language ngano (storysong or chante fable) performance is used to argue for the contextualized study of ideophones which links their acoustic and kinesthetic dimensions to performance-generated meaning. Based on fieldwork in Zimbabwe (Chapter 1), the analysis is effected through a melding of indigenous Shona and scholarly western theory on narrative performance and iconicity (Chapter 2). Initially, it draws on indigenous performance theory and Roman Jakobson's distinction between a narrated event and a narrative or speech event to create a transcription which represents the dialogue of voices-narrative characters, performance participants, and researcher's observations-present in the ngano performance and its analysis (Chapter 3). Next, the study focuses on the role of ideophones as a rhetorical device akin to reported speech in shaping and being shaped by both discourse structure and the dialogue of genres inherent in a hybrid genre like the storysong (Chapter 4). Subsequently, it combines indigenous theory of acoustic and gestural ideophonic performance with Charles Peirce's approach to iconicity (imagistic, diagrammatic, and metaphoric), to examine the interrelationship among ideophonic sound, movement, and meaning (Chapter 5). Both discourse and lexical-level analyses illustrate the multilayered nature of ideophonic iconicity: how ideophones participate in and shift attention between a past event, a present performance, the creativity and life experience of a narrator, and the cultural memory implicit in a given performance. Lastly, the study relates the use of ideophones to notions of directness, indirectness, and respect within the Shona economy of communication, demonstrating the interrelationship of micro-level aesthetics with macro-level cultural concerns and reinforcing the argument for the contextualized study of ideophones.","note":"New Edition","author":[{"family":"Klassen","given":"Doreen Helen"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1999]]},"title-short":"'You Can't Have Silence with Your Palms Up'"},

We report two experiments testing an alternative that emphasizes consonants and natural semantic distinctions flowing from the auditory perceptual quality of salient acoustic differences among them. Our experiments replicated previous studies using similar word and image materials but included additional conditions swapping the consonant and vowel contents of words; using novel, randomly generated words and images; and presenting words either visually or aurally.

Although several factors are known to regulate grapheme-color associations, the impact of factors, including their interrelationships, on synesthesia remains unclear. We investigated determinants of synesthetic color for graphemes (characters, letters) of Hiragana, a phonetic script in the Japanese language, and the English alphabet. Results revealed that grapheme ordinality was the strongest predictor of synesthetic colors for Hiragana characters, followed by character sound, and visual shape. Ordinality and visual shapes also significantly predicted synesthetic colors for English alphabet letters, however, sounds did not. The relative impact of grapheme properties on grapheme-color associations and the differences between these two writing systems are accounted for by considering the way graphemes are processed in the brain and introduced during an individual's development. A new model is proposed which takes into account the developmental process of grapheme learning. The model provides comprehensive explanation of synesthetic grapheme-color association determination processes, including the differences across writing systems.","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3822291/","DOI":"10.3389/fnhum.2013.00757","ISSN":"1662-5161","author":[{"family":"Asano","given":"Michiko"},{"family":"Yokosawa","given":"Kazuhiko"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,11,11]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",5,29]]},"PMID":"24273504","PMCID":"PMC3822291","title-short":"Grapheme learning and grapheme-color synesthesia","container-title-short":"Front Hum Neurosci"},

We examine this assumption in two ways. First, we show that letter position and syllable stress have been confounded, such that the initial letters of a word are often in stressed position (e.g., 'wo-man,'ta-ble,'ha-ppy). With participant JW, we separate these factors (e.g., with stress homographs such as 'con-vict vs. con-'vict) and show that the primary determinant of word colour is syllable stress, with only a secondary influence of letter position. We show that this effect derives from conceptual rather than perceptual stress, and that the effect is more prominent for synaesthetes whose words are coloured by vowels than by consonants. We examine, too, the time course of word colour generation. Slower colour naming occurs for spoken versus written stimuli, as we might expect from the additional requirement of grapheme conversion in the former. Reaction time data provide evidence, too, of incremental processing, since word colour is generated faster when the dominant grapheme is flagged early rather than late in the spoken word. Finally, we examine the role of non-dominant graphemes in word colouring and show faster colour naming when later graphemes match the dominant grapheme (e.g., ether) compared to when they do not (e.g., ethos). Taken together, our findings suggest that words are coloured incrementally by a process of competition between constituent graphemes, in which stressed graphemes and word-initial graphemes are disproportionately weighted.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B8JH1-4S03J1G-M/1/5447467c6e2d502c6a7bf12f4c957a44","DOI":"10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70353-8","author":[{"family":"Simner","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Glover","given":"Louise"},{"family":"Mowat","given":"Alice"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",6,8]]}},

Very little systematic research has been done on it, and textbooks for non-native speakers include only the least sound-symbolic few of the system which could be readily checked in conventional dictionairies. In attempting to remedy the situation, this dissertation demonstrates that Japanese mimetic words indeed constitute a sound-symbolic system which has implications not only to the study of sound symbolism in general but also to the historical sound change in Japanese. The dissertation first deals with the formal characteristics of the sound-symbolic system. The syntactical, morphological, and phonotactic properties are described. The accentual properties of the system are next described, leading to the characterization of the system as a continuum between the more iconic and the less iconic. The sound symbolism of both monosyllabic and bisyllabic mimetic adverbs is treated. Concrete evidence is presented to demonstrate that there indeed are systematic ties between the semantic and phonological components of these mimetic words. For instance, the semantics of the voiceless bilabial stop in monosyllabic mimetic adverbs is broken down to 'abrupt movement, stretched-out surface or line, light/small/fine' corresponding to its phonological features of 'explosive, bilabial, voiceless.' Functional differences between positions are also clarified. The first consonant, for instance, is demonstrated to denote 'texture,' while the second denotes 'movement.' The dissertation furthermore demonstrates two aspects of the mimetic phonology which are related to the historical sound change of Japanese, namely palatalization and bilabial stops in the second syllable. Based upon the distributional characteristics of palatalized syllables, it is concluded that palatalization in the sound-symbolic system has an origin different from that of palatalization in Sino-Japanese loan words. Also, based upon the distributional and semantic characteristics of bilabial stops, it is suggested that the voiced bilabial stop in the second syllable, or in intervocalic position, in mimetic words derives from the voiceless bilabial stop.","note":"Ph.D.","author":[{"family":"Hamano","given":"Shoko S."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1986]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",1,13]]}},

Although synesthesia is often referred to as a “neurological condition,” it is not listed in the DSM IV or the ICD classifications, as it generally does not interfere with normal daily functioning. However, its high prevalence rate (one in 23) means that synesthesia may be reported by patients who present with other psychiatric symptoms. In this review, I focus on recent research examining the neural basis of the two most intensively studied forms of synesthesia, grapheme → color synesthesia and tone → color synesthesia. These data suggest that these forms of synesthesia are elicited through anomalous activation of color-selective areas, perhaps in concert with hyper-binding mediated by the parietal cortex. I then turn to questions for future research and the implications of these models for other forms of synesthesia.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11920-007-0018-6","DOI":"10.1007/s11920-007-0018-6","author":[{"family":"Hubbard","given":"Edward"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,6,25]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",6,8]]}},

Two sensory organs, the compound eyes and mechanosensory hindwings called halteres, are capable of encoding angular velocity of the body during flight. Although motor reflexes driven by the two modalities have been studied individually, little is known about how the two sensory feedback channels are integrated during flight. Using a specialized flight simulator we presented tethered flies with simultaneous visual and mechanosensory oscillations while measuring compensatory changes in stroke kinematics. By varying the relative amplitude, phase and axis of rotation of the visual and mechanical stimuli, we were able to determine the contribution of each sensory modality to the compensatory motor reflex. Our results show that over a wide range of experimental conditions sensory inputs from halteres and the visual system are combined in a weighted sum. Furthermore, the weighting structure places greater influence on feedback from the halteres than from the visual system.","URL":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/207/1/133","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.00731","author":[{"family":"Sherman","given":"Alana"},{"family":"Dickinson","given":"Michael H."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,1,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",9,1]]}},

The first chapter presents a typology of iconicity in phonosemantics based upon observations made by Bellugi and Klima (1978) on iconicity in sign languages. Onomatopes evidence transparent iconicity. Sound symbolic words exhibit translucent iconicity. Phonesthemes and ideophones evidence opaque iconicity. Chapters Two through Four examine issues of ideophony. Two psycholinguistic experiments using Yoruba ideophonic stimuli are described. In the first experiment non-Yoruba-speaking subjects correctly matched Yoruba ideophones (presented aurally) to English translations at statistically significant levels. In the second experiment similar subjects were not able to correctly assign semantic domains (represented as poles of semantic oppositions) to their respective Yoruba ideophonic word-sets (presented aurally). In an experiment using Korean ideophone pairs as stimuli, non-Korean-speaking (native and non-native English-speaking) subjects were able to match the specific meaning given of one member of aurally presented pairs to the correct ideophone at statistically significant levels. The following three chapters examine phonesthesia in English. These include the results of a survey of native speaker judgements concerning the \"relatedness\" among words containing phonesthemes, a replication using non-native English-speaking subjects of Markel and Hamp's (1960-61) experiment on five initial consonant clusters with differing results, and experimental evidence using native Arabic and Japanese non-English-speaking subjects which suggests little role for universal sound symbolism in English phonesthesia. Thus, the experimental results of the dissertation support a psychological distinction between types of iconic sound-meaning correlations. The last chapter is devoted to a formalism suitable for the representation of supralexical phonosemantic correlations within a grammar: Autolexical Semantics. The formalism is applied to example cases of ideophones in English, Korean, Yoruba, and Zulu.","note":"Ph.D.","author":[{"family":"Fordyce","given":"James Forrest"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1988]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",1,13]]},"publisher-place":"Los Angeles"},

To determine the neural locus of this condition, we compared behavioral and fMRI responses in six grapheme-color synesthetes to control subjects. In our behavioral experiments, we found that a subject's synesthetic experience can aid in texture segregation (experiment 1) and reduce the effects of crowding (experiment 2). For synesthetes, graphemes produced larger fMRI responses in color-selective area human V4 than for control subjects (experiment 3). Importantly, we found a correlation within subjects between the behavioral and fMRI results; subjects with better performance on the behavioral experiments showed larger fMRI responses in early retinotopic visual areas (V1, V2, V3, and hV4). These results suggest that grapheme-color synesthesia is the result of cross-activation between grapheme-selective and color-selective brain areas. The correlation between the behavioral and fMRI results suggests that grapheme-color synesthetes may constitute a heterogeneous group.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WSS-4FSDFBK-K/2/33956ffe70401d6ec86dbc017ef5cdb4","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuron.2005.02.008","ISSN":"0896-6273","author":[{"family":"Hubbard","given":"Edward M."},{"family":"Arman","given":"A.

It is presently unknown whether this reflects early or late processes in the brain. It is also unknown whether adult audiovisual synesthesia resembles auditory-induced visual illusions that can sometimes occur in the general population or whether it resembles the electrophysiological deflection over occipital sites that has been noted in infancy and has been likened to synesthesia. Electrical brain activity was recorded from adult synesthetes and control participants who were played brief tones and required to monitor for an infrequent auditory target. The synesthetes were instructed to attend either to the auditory or to the visual (i.e., synesthetic) dimension of the tone, whereas the controls attended to the auditory dimension alone. There were clear differences between synesthetes and controls that emerged early (100 msec after tone onset). These differences tended to lie in deflections of the auditory-evoked potential (e.g., the auditory N1, P2, and N2) rather than the presence of an additional posterior deflection. The differences occurred irrespective of what the synesthetes attended to (although attention had a late effect). The results suggest that differences between synesthetes and others occur early in time, and that synesthesia is qualitatively different from similar effects found in infants and certain auditory-induced visual illusions in adults. In addition, we report two novel cases of synesthesia in which colors elicit sounds, and vice versa.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/jocn.2009.21134","DOI":"10.1162/jocn.2009.21134","author":[{"family":"Goller","given":"Aviva I."},{"family":"Otten","given":"Leun J."},{"family":"Ward","given":"Jamie"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,10,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",7,21]]},"title-short":"Seeing Sounds and Hearing Colors"},

Although discussed in the literature well over a century ago, synesthesia slipped out of the scientific spotlight for decades because of the difficulty in verifying and quantifying private perceptual experiences. In recent years, the study of synesthesia has enjoyed a renaissance due to the introduction of tests that demonstrate the reality of the condition, its automatic and involuntary nature, and its measurable perceptual consequences. However, while several research groups now study synesthesia, there is no single protocol for comparing, contrasting and pooling synesthetic subjects across these groups. There is no standard battery of tests, no quantifiable scoring system, and no standard phrasing of questions. Additionally, the tests that exist offer no means for data comparison. To remedy this deficit we have devised the Synesthesia Battery. This unified collection of tests is freely accessible online (http://www.synesthete.org). It consists of a questionnaire and several online software programs, and test results are immediately available for use by synesthetes and invited researchers. Performance on the tests is quantified with a standard scoring system. We introduce several novel tests here, and offer the software for running the tests. By presenting standardized procedures for testing and comparing subjects, this endeavor hopes to speed scientific progress in synesthesia research.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T04-4PNJ1KK-N/1/f7cec2bb648552a96cfa146cd2fc3d6c","DOI":"10.1016/j.jneumeth.2006.07.012","author":[{"family":"Eagleman","given":"David M."},{"family":"Kagan","given":"Arielle D."},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Stephanie S."},{"family":"Sagaram","given":"Deepak"},{"family":"Sarma","given":"Anand K."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,1,15]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",6,8]]}},

For example, the sound of a particular piano note may be [`]seen' as a unique colour, or the taste of a familiar food may be [`]felt' as a distinct bodily sensation. We report a study of 192 adult synaesthetes, in which we administered a structured questionnaire to determine the relative frequency and characteristics of different types of synaesthetic experience. Our data suggest the prevalence of synaesthesia in the adult population is approximately 1 in 1150 females and 1 in 7150 males. The incidence of left-handedness in our sample was within the normal range, contrary to previous claims. We did, however, find that synaesthetes are more likely to be involved in artistic pursuits, consistent with anecdotal reports. We also examined responses from a subset of 150 synaesthetes for whom letters, digits and words induce colour experiences ([`]lexical-colour' synaesthesia). There was a striking consistency in the colours induced by certain letters and digits in these individuals. For example, [`]R' elicited red for 36% of the sample, [`]Y' elicited yellow for 45%, and [`]D' elicited brown for 47%. Similar trends were apparent for a group of non-synaesthetic controls who were asked to associate colours with letters and digits. Based on these findings, we suggest that the development of lexical-colour synaesthesia in many cases incorporates early learning experiences common to all individuals. Moreover, many of our synaesthetes experienced colours only for days of the week, letters or digits, suggesting that inducers that are part of a conventional sequence (e.g. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...; A, B, C...; 1, 2, 3...) may be particularly important in the development of synaesthetic inducer-colour pairs. We speculate that the learning of such sequences during an early critical period determines the particular pattern of lexical-colour links, and that this pattern then generalises to other words.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T24-4F6MDFV-1/2/47fbed3eb74b981b392fe8716785e1fb","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2004.11.003","ISSN":"0010-0277","author":[{"family":"Rich","given":"A.N."},{"family":"Bradshaw","given":"J.L."},{"family":"Mattingley","given":"J.B."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,11]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",6,23]]},"title-short":"A systematic, large-scale study of synaesthesia"},

Metaphorical expressions---adjectives borrowed into the auditory domain from other sensory domains---are analyzed from the perspective of Cognitive Linguistics, focusing on the key theoretical issues of Conceptual Metaphor Theory and primary metaphor theory: motivation, directionality, and universality. More specifically, it analyzes physical motivations of metaphors, explains the unidirectional tendency of the mapping, and suggests candidacies for universal metaphors. As background, relevant findings from the following fields are discussed: philosophy, literature, anthropology, music theory, acoustics, psychology, and neuroscience. Examination of different types of conceptual mappings suggests that all metaphors arise from sensory experience and can be categorized as either correlation or resemblance, although each metaphor may have multiple motivations of both types. For analyzing synesthetic metaphors of sound, the three levels---perception, cognition, and language---are characterized as follows: (1) humans share the biological process of hearing and vocalization; (2) culture determines which conceptual mappings are emphasized within the universally available mappings; (3) language restricts how concepts are overtly represented. Corpus analysis shows that the twenty adjectives investigated have similar meanings and usages in English and Japanese, but there are some differences at the linguistic level (e.g., onomatopoeia) or conceptual level (e.g., metaphor). These two levels are pursued with experiments of two tasks (description, adjective) involving two independent variables: language (English, Japanese) and sound types (environmental sound, music, speech). The description task reveals how language-specific aspects including grammatical categories and lexical items influence the descriptions of sound. The adjective task reveals which synesthetic mappings are selected among the cross-culturally shared choices based on socio-cultural factors. It is suggested that the linguistic and conceptual levels need to be distinguished by considering the semantic network of each adjective. This study demonstrates that the expressions of sensory phenomena are determined by both the nature of the stimuli and cultural characteristics. Communication involves the integration of perceptual and cognitive information, which may be either universal or culture-specific. Thus, language reflects the interface between perception and cognition.","note":"Ph.D.","author":[{"family":"Takada","given":"Mari"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",6,12]]},"title-short":"Synesthetic metaphor"},

Likewise, perception of a form (e.g., a letter) may induce a color percept (i.e., grapheme-color synesthesia). To date, the neural mechanisms underlying synesthesia remain to be elucidated. We disclosed by fMRI, while controlling for surface color processing, enhanced activity in the left intraparietal cortex during the experience of grapheme-color synesthesia (n�=�9). In contrast, the perception of surface color per se activated the color centers in the fusiform gyrus bilaterally. The data support theoretical accounts that grapheme-color synesthesia may originate from enhanced cross-modal binding of form and color. A mismatch of surface color and grapheme induced synesthetically felt color additionally activated the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). This suggests that cognitive control processes become active to resolve the perceptual conflict resulting from synesthesia.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WNP-4GX64TY-1/1/026bbb31b59d4faf5ff3a8faab040938","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.06.052","author":[{"family":"Weiss","given":"Peter H."},{"family":"Zilles","given":"Karl"},{"family":"Fink","given":"Gereon R."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,11]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",6,8]]},"title-short":"When visual perception causes feeling"},

This article aims to provide four types of evidence that OLP constitutes a form of synesthesia and is likely to have the same neurodevelopmental basis. We show that (a) OLP significantly co-occurs with other variants of synesthesia, (b) OLP associations (like those of synesthesia) are highly consistent over time (Experiment 1), (c) OLP associations (like those of synesthesia) have the characteristic of letter-to-word transference (i.e., they spread from initial letters throughout words) (Experiment 2), and (d) OLP associations (like those of synesthesia) are automatically generated and interfere in Stroop-type tasks (Experiment 3). We argue that these shared characteristics suggest a unified underlying behavior, and propose OLP as a subtype of synesthesia.

  {"id":"ciccotosto_sound_1991","type":"thesis","title":"Sound symbolism in natural languages","publisher":"University of Florida","genre":"PhD dissertation","source":"ProQuest","abstract":"A major assumption in modern linguistics is that sounds composing words arbitrarily associate with meanings. Saussure's early 20th century arbitrary sound-meaning tenet has been neither adequately examined nor challenged. This dissertation casts doubt upon this theory by gathering evidence of sound symbolism from virtually all known language phyla. Major sound symbolism experiments are reviewed, and finally, a series of sound symbolism hypotheses is proposed for a group of basic vocabulary words. These glottochronological words, of a supposed arbitrary sound-meaning nature, are routinely utilized by linguists to trace genetic relationships among language phyla. Dissertation data are composed of a lexical sample representing 1% of 5000 world languages. Sixteen glosses contain 50 words per meaning from 50 languages, and are taken from at least 10 of the 17 human language phyla. The set includes: Neck, Tooth, Mouth, Nose, Cough, Eat, Drink, Vomit, Breast, Suck, Dog, Swallow, Spit, Food, Water, and Chew. These 800 glosses, taken from a pool of 229 languages, are tallied according to sub-phonemic distinctive articulatory and acoustic features such as nasal, stop, spirant, bilabial, and others. For the 16 concepts, a total of 63 hypotheses are proposed. Each hypothesis argues that certain sub-phonemic features are to be found at higher or lower levels than those in the remaining sample of 750 words. Chi-square tests run on 63 hypotheses give 23 instances of association at significant levels, p $<$.05. The application of the rank-order median test of Kruskal-Wallis to the same hypotheses gives similar results. For the ordered alternative Jonckheere-Terpstra test, all predicted features based on three k-samples are highly significant. Such synchronically extensive sound symbolism is striking. Sound symbolism, within the basic behavioral and physiological meanings of these words, shows a hierarchy of sub-phonemic features. Their evolutionary adaptive value may allow conspecifics facile entry into a communication network.","note":"Ph.D.","author":[{"family":"Ciccotosto","given":"Nick"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1991]]},"publisher-place":"Florida"},

When they get mentioned, they are often treated as marginal to or even outside of language proper. So far, there have been very few serious synchronic or diachronic studies devoted to this part of the lexicon. This dissertation is an attempt to provide a thorough description and a systematic analysis of the phonological aspects of the sound-symbolic words and expressions in three major Chinese languages: Mandarin, Cantonese and Hakka. In consideration of the spoken nature of sound-symbolic vocabulary, the primary source of data for this study came from present-day speech. Published materials were used as secondary data after verification by native speakers. Collected data were examined intra- and interlinguistically from both synchronic and diachronic perspectives. The goals of this study are: (1) To enhance our knowledge of Chinese phonologies by taking sound-symbolic vocabulary into account; (2) To explore whether an empirical basis exists for a theoretical distinction between the phonology of ordinary language and that of sound-symbolic language; and (3) To test the general hypothesis about onomatopoetic resistance to sound change. Discussion of the findings draws upon the insights of current theories such as Lexical Phonology, Autosegmental Phonology, Natural Phonology, and the Lexical Diffusion Model for sound change. Chapter One provides the background to the present study, defines onomatopoeia and ideophone, and introduces the theoretical frameworks in which the data are discussed. Chapter Two summarizes previous findings in Chinese and other languages. Chapter Three outlines the phonological systems of Mandarin, Cantonese and Hakka. Chapter Four presents the objective of this study, research questions, sources of data, and fieldwork. Chapter Five provides quantitative and qualitative analyses of the collected data. Chapter Six focuses on reduplication. Chapter Seven deals with tone change and tone sandhi. Chapter Eight discusses various descriptive and theoretical issues of Chinese sound-symbolic vocabulary. Chapter Nine explores the implications of the findings for linguistic theory and concludes the study with a brief synopsis of the findings and remarks.","note":"Ph.D.","author":[{"family":"Mok","given":"Waiching Enid"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"title-short":"Chinese sound symbolism"},

In visual-hearing synaesthesia, for example, higher pitched sounds induce visual images that are brighter, smaller, higher in space, and sharper than those induced by lower pitched sounds. Claims that neonatal perception is synaesthetic imply that such correspondences are an unlearned aspect of perception. To date, the youngest children in whom such correspondences have been confirmed with any certainty were 2- to 3-year-olds. We examined preferential looking to assess 3- to 4-month-old preverbal infants’ sensitivity to the correspondences linking auditory pitch to visuospatial height and visual sharpness. The infants looked longer at a changing visual display when this was accompanied by a sound whose changing pitch was congruent, rather than incongruent, with these correspondences. This is the strongest indication to date that synaesthetic cross-modality correspondences are an unlearned aspect of perception.","URL":"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/21/1/21.abstract","DOI":"10.1177/0956797609354734","author":[{"family":"Walker","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Bremner","given":"J.

Ideophones rarely function as heads of constructions, & in some cases represent the epitome of content words in showing almost pure content & no syntax. In terms of their phonological status, ideophones typically violate the segmental & prosodic constraints of their matrix language & are governed by few phonological rules. Ideophones display little morphology; repeated or prolonged ideophones generally have an iconic component in that the elongation represents extension in time or space. Ideophones tend to be very specific - they usually evoke a concrete image, appeal to the senses, & have a narrow meaning. They rely on nonarbitrary relations between sound & meaning. Onomatopoeia plays an important role in the composition of ideophones, especially in terms of animal cries & engine noises. Synesthesia refers to the pairing of certain words with nonauditory human sensations & represents another nonarbitrary association of sound with meaning. 106 References. K.

A related observation is that Runa and Achuar people share an animistic cosmology whereby animals, plants, and even seemingly inert entities such as rocks and stones are believed to have a life force or essence with a subjectivity that can be expressed. This paper will focus on Quichua speaking Runa to seek linguistic evidence for animacy by examining the sound-symbolic properties of a class of expressions called ideophones. I argue that structural features of ideophones such as canonical length and diversity of sound segments as well as type of sound segments, help express the animism of the Runa lifeworld. Moreover, although these features are not indicative of any essential distinctions between plants and animals, they may be indicative of a scalar view of animacy, along the lines suggested by Descola who first proposed a continuum or ‘ladder of animacy’ for the Achuar [1, pp. 321-326]. Ideophones, then, may be understood as one set of linguistic tools for coming to terms with the diversity of their ecological setting, a setting which spans highly animate humans and animals, through less animate plants, trees, and rocks.","ISSN":"1424-2818","author":[{"family":"Nuckolls","given":"Janis B."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]}},

Until recently, it was assumed that synesthesia occurs strictly unidirectional: Although the perception of a letter induces a color percept in letter–color synesthetes, they typically do not report that colors trigger the percept of a letter. Recent data on number processing in synesthesia suggest, however, that colors can implicitly elicit numerical representations in digit–color synesthetes, thereby questioning unidirectional models of synesthesia. Using a word fragment completion paradigm in 10 letter–color synesthetes, we show here for the first time that colors can implicitly influence lexical search.

In Korean, the function of ideophones is immense. They play an important role in expanding vocabulary through various derivational processes and they fulfill fundamental meanings as well as express subtle connotations not otherwise available in the lexicon. In spite of this, ideophones in Korean remain one of the least understood aspects of the language.\nThe question of what exactly is an ideophone in Korean is not so evident, since semantically expressive words range between those that are typically ideophonic and those that are less so. This study is an attempt to reveal the systematic nature of ideophones in Korean and the way they are interwoven in the language by offering a classification of ideophones in Korean.\nBy identifying [ATR] and [RTR] as morphemic features based on the phonetic correlation in sound symbolism, I offer a constrained way to treat vowel harmony in ideophones. Additionally, I address the question of supposed universal characteristics of sound symbolism in the languages of the world in view of the evidence found in the Korean data. I propose that magnitude symbolism represented by [ATR] and [RTR] vowels in Korean is motivated as follows: [ATR] vowels symbolize Augmentative, reflecting the wider pharynx resulting from advancing the tongue root; [RTR] vowels which are produced with narrower pharynx by virtue of retracting the tongue symbolize Diminutive. An analysis of consonant play in ideophones is offered in which the laryngeal features [+Constricted Glottis] and [+Spread Glottis] are identified as morphemic features which are associated with intensifying degrees.\n\nAdditionally, special focus is given to the phenomenon of reduplication in ideophones. By adopting the theory of prosodic morphology, I posit a constrained way of handling the various types of reduplication that are observed in Korean ideophones.","author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Jin-Seong"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1992]]}},

This theme can be distilled into three rather distinct claims: (1) iconic principles govern speakers' choices of structurally available options in discourse; (2) structural options that reflect discourse-iconic principles become grammaticalized; (3) grammatical structure is an iconic reflection of conceptual structure. After presenting numerous examples from the functionalist literature in support of the idea that iconicity is widespread in language, I argue that claim (1) is irrelevant to generative grammar; claim (2), if correct, poses no challenge to generative grammar, despite a widespread belief to the contrary; and claim (3) has literally been built into standard versions of generative grammar.

Although the condition has been traditionally viewed as an anomaly (e.g., breakdown in modularity), it seems that at least some of the mechanisms underlying synesthesia do reflect universal crossmodal mechanisms. We review here a number of examples of crossmodal correspondences found in both synesthetes and nonsynesthetes including pitch-lightness and vision-touch interaction, as well as cross-domain spatial-numeric interactions. Additionally, we discuss the common role of spatial attention in binding shape and color surface features (whether ordinary or synesthetic color).

Six basic figures were employed (circle, ellipse, right triangle, isosceles triangle, along with two historical psycholinguistic forms—uloomu and takete) and varied on three dimensions of size, complexity, and density. The results of the study indicate that there was consistency in the assignment of pure-tone frequencies to the dimensions of the figures and that the pattern of assignment was generally similar for both English- and Urdu-speaking subjects alike. Specifically, for both language groups, round figures (circles and ellipses) were assigned significantly lower frequencies than other stimuli. Also, complex and dense figures (i.e., those designed to simulate “visual depth” and “visual texture,” respectively) received significantly higher frequency settings than those stimuli not possessing these dimensions. Additional analyses revealed several factors that may have contributed to the observed pattern. For example, Urdu subjects of high English proficiency produced frequency assignments that closely resembled those of the English-speaking subjects, while subjects of low English proficiency produced a pattern that was somewhat different, particularly with regard to round, complex figures. Length of residency in the United States (6 months, 1 year, or 2 years), however, did not significantly influence frequency assignments for the Urdu subjects.

Here, we report stronger associations when second-order similarity mappings are examined—specifically, mappings between the synesthetic colors of letters and letter shape, frequency, and position in the alphabet. The analyses demonstrate that these relations are independent of one other. More strikingly, our analyses show that each of the letter–color mappings is restricted to one dimension of color, with letter shape and ordinality linked to hue, and letter frequency linked to luminance. These results imply that synesthetic associations are acquired as the alphabet is learned, with associations involving letter shape, ordinality, and frequency being made independently and idiosyncratically. Because these mappings of similarity structure between domains (letters and colors) are similar to those found in numerous other cognitive and perceptual domains, they imply that synesthetic associations operate on principles common to many aspects of human cognition.","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-011-0208-4","DOI":"10.3758/s13423-011-0208-4","ISSN":"1069-9384, 1531-5320","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Watson","given":"Marcus R."},{"family":"Akins","given":"Kathleen A."},{"family":"Enns","given":"James T."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,1,10]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",4,20]]},"container-title-short":"Psychon Bull Rev"},

Although long treated as a curiosity, recent research with a combination of phenomenological, behavioral, and neuroimaging methods has begun to identify the cognitive and neural basis of synesthesia. Here, we review this literature with an emphasis on grapheme-color synesthesia, in which viewing letters and numbers induces the perception of colors. We discuss both the substantial progress that has been made in the past fifteen years and some open questions. In particular, we focus on debates in the field relating to the neural basis of synesthesia, including the relationship between synesthesia and attention and the role of meaning in synesthetic colors. We propose that some, but probably not all, of these differences can be accounted for by differences in the synesthetes studied and discuss some methodological implications of these individual differences.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WSS-4HG6BDW-C/1/55bcac4411997c5a48b32790412683ed","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuron.2005.10.012","author":[{"family":"Hubbard","given":"Edward M."},{"family":"Ramachandran","given":"V.S."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,11,3]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",6,8]]}},

  {"id":"baronti_sound_2001","type":"thesis","title":"Sound symbolism use in affect verbs in Santa Catarina Ixtahuacan","publisher":"University of California, Davis","genre":"PhD dissertation","source":"ProQuest","abstract":"Anthropological linguists continue to investigate sound symbolism, even though the subject is dismissed out of hand by some mainstream linguists. Prominent scholars offered insights earlier in the century. Now, a recent Berkeley volume exemplifies wider, multi-disciplinary interests. A focus of scholarship that offers investigative promise involves a type of verb, common in the word's languages, that conveys a particular sense of immediacy, emotion, and vividness. In Australian and African languages, these verbs are called ideophones, in Japanese gitaigo, and in Mayan languages affect verbs. But relevant Mayan studies have only been realized in the Greater Tzeltalan family. The reasons have to do with the readily identifiable morphosyntactic markers that characterize these verbs in those languages. However, languages are more than the sums of their grammatical markers. Cognate verbs and suffixes are found in K'iche'. These K'iche' verbs are prominent in the same domains (e.g., ethnosymptomatology) in which they are found in the Chiapas languages. The relationships between these words across languages are striking. In K'iche' they seem to be used mostly by older people in culture-specific activities, and also include some morphosyntactic features of their own such as lexical and feature metathesis, as well as certain semantic characteristics--for example, their use of \"saliency devices\" such as metonymy and sound symbolism. K'ichean sound symbolism can be divided into three forms: (1) phonemic (in which semantic values for the language's phonemes are identifiable); (2) onomatopoeic (in which most of the roots of the language are seen to be sound symbolic via a kuub'an kind of construction, and (3) desinence or \"form\" symbolism, in which the desinence contributes to a stem's semantic value. Phonemic symbolism often involves a figure/ground relationship between the initial and final consonants such that one modifies or \"fine tunes\" the other. The town of Santa Catarina Ixtahuacán, the site for this study, has recently experienced traumatic cultural changes. The changes that are occurring beneath the surface are even profounder than the dramatic changes involving the relocation of the town, which occurred above it. These changes threaten the existence of traditional language forms such as affect verbs and sound symbolism.","note":"Ph.D.","author":[{"family":"Baronti","given":"David Scott"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]}},

A study is presented in which nine subjects were tested who also reported having coloured hearing. The following questions were addressed: (a) were these cases also genuine (ie consistent over time), (b) were they truly lexical, or rather variants of this condition, such as chromatic - graphemic (CG) or chromatic - phonemic (CP) synaesthesia, (c) did the experimental subjects show any commonalities between them, and (d) were they able to give information on a standard questionnaire about the phenomenology and ontogenesis of the condition? Subjects were asked to describe the colour sensation experienced on hearing items from a list of 130 words, phrases, and letters. The experimental group were not informed of any retest, but were retested more than one year later. A control group (n = 9), matched for IQ, memory, age, and gender, were read the same list and asked to associate a colour with each list item. They were informed at the time of testing that they would be retested on a sample of items from the list a week later. 92.3% of the responses of the experimental group when retested one year later were identical to those given in the original test, compared with only 37.6% of the control subjects' responses (retested one week later). This confirmed the genuineness of these nine cases. All nine experimental subjects showed CG synaesthesia, none showing either CL or CP synaesthesia. Among the experimental group, some consistency was found in the colours evoked by hearing specific letters, suggesting the condition has a neurological basis. There was also evidence of a genetic sex-linked familial pattern underlying the condition. The importance of these distinct forms of synaesthesia for our understanding of the modularity of speech perception and colour vision is discussed.","URL":"http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=p220419","DOI":"10.1068/p220419","author":[{"family":"Baron-Cohen","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Harrison","given":"John"},{"family":"Goldstein","given":"Laura H"},{"family":"Wyke","given":"Maria"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1993]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",6,8]]},"title-short":"Coloured speech perception"},

JIW shows a highly structured, non-random relationship between particular combinations of phonemes (rather than graphemes) and the resultant taste, and this is influenced by a number of fine-grained phonemic properties (e.g. allophony, phoneme ordering). The synaesthesia is not found for environmental sounds. The synaesthesia, in its current form, is likely to have originated during vocabulary acquisition, since it is guided by learned linguistic and conceptual knowledge. The phonemes that trigger a given taste tend to also appear in the name of the corresponding foodstuff (e.g. //, /n/ and /s/ can trigger a taste of mince /mns/) and there is often a semantic association between the triggering word and taste (e.g. the word blue tastes \"inky\"). The results suggest that synaesthesia does not simply reflect innate connections from one perceptual system to another, but that it can be mediated and/or influenced by a symbolic/conceptual level of representation.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T24-498V0RM-1/2/2ca09ff948cee5f701af58da87655202","DOI":"10.1016/S0010-0277(03)00122-7","ISSN":"0010-0277","author":[{"family":"Ward","given":"Jamie"},{"family":"Simner","given":"Julia"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,10]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",7,29]]},"title-short":"Lexical-gustatory synaesthesia"},

We find that when we stretch the facial skin while people listen to words, it alters the sounds they hear. The systematic perceptual variation we observe in conjunction with speech-like patterns of skin stretch indicates that somatosensory inputs affect the neural processing of speech sounds and shows the involvement of the somatosensory system in the perceptual processing in speech.","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/01/21/0810063106.abstract","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0810063106","author":[{"family":"Ito","given":"Takayuki"},{"family":"Tiede","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Ostry","given":"David J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,1,21]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2011",3,29]]}},

Isomorphism is so nearly universal that deviations from it require explanation. Motivation, although widespread, establishes a typology of languages, as indicated in Saussure's Cours.

Ideophones associate almost exclusively with verbs in one of the past tenses & with perfective aspectual sense; the attestation with nonpast verbs is generally perfective in sense. YY ideophones have a unique statistical pattern for initial sounds & exhibit sound & syllable types not found in ordinary words, although their phonology does seem to parallel the regular sound system of the language. The ideophones of other Australian languages are compared. Many ideophones have a prototypical association with a single verb or family of nearly synonymous verbs.

The members of this class are phonologically aberrant in certain patterned ways, are exempt from regular sound change, tend to be onomatopoeic & sound-symbolic in certain limited ways, & constitute the only vocal communicative noises permitted in social contexts where speech is otherwise forbidden.

The prevalence of number forms was found to be significantly higher in synaesthetes experiencing colour compared both to synaesthetes experiencing taste and to control participants lacking any synaesthetic experience. This suggests that the presence of synaesthetic colour sensations enhances the tendency to explicitly represent numbers in a visuo-spatial format although the two symptoms may nevertheless be logically independent (i.e. it is possible to have number forms without colour, and coloured numbers without forms). Number forms are equally common in men and women, unlike previous reports of synaesthesia that have suggested a strong female bias. Individuals who possess a number form are also likely to possess visuo-spatial forms for other ordinal sequences (e.g. days, months, letters) which suggests that it is the ordinal nature of numbers rather than numerical quantity that gives rise to this particular mode of representation. Finally, we also describe some consequences of number forms for performance in a number comparison task.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T24-4HHH60D-4/2/350b4ab7a8708f4ab55b5da8d5c387a0","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2005.09.004","ISSN":"0010-0277","author":[{"family":"Sagiv","given":"Noam"},{"family":"Simner","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Collins","given":"James"},{"family":"Butterworth","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Ward","given":"Jamie"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,8]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",7,29]]}},

In this paper we demonstrate that the particular colors seen by a grapheme-color synesthete AED were learned from a set of refrigerator magnets and that the synesthesia later transferred to Cyrillic in a systematic way, with the colors induced by the Cyrillic letters determined by their visual or phonetic similarity to English letters. Closer examination of the data reveals that letters of either language that are more visually similar to the English capitals in the magnet set are also more saturated. In order to differentiate AED's synesthesia from ordinary memory, we use a novel psychophysical method to show that AED's synesthetic colors are subject to ordinary lightness constancy mechanisms. This suggests that the level of representation at which her synesthesia arises is early in the stream of visual processing.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B8JH1-4S03J1G-7/2/b661614e4d7c1ab66ce82004b3a5b5f4","DOI":"10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70342-3","ISSN":"0010-9452","author":[{"family":"Witthoft","given":"Nathan"},{"family":"Winawer","given":"Jonathan"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",6,23]]}},

Here, we report that 25-month-old children are sensitive to cross-linguistically valid sound-symbolic matches in the domain of action and that this sound symbolism facilitates verb learning in young children. We constructed a set of novel sound-symbolic verbs whose sounds were judged to match certain actions better than others, as confirmed by adult Japanese- as well as English speakers, and by 2- and 3-year-old Japanese-speaking children. These sound-symbolic verbs, together with other novel non-sound-symbolic verbs, were used in a verb learning task with 3-year-old Japanese children. In line with the previous literature, 3-year-olds could not generalize the meaning of novel non-sound-symbolic verbs on the basis of the sameness of action. However, 3-year-olds could correctly generalize the meaning of novel sound-symbolic verbs. These results suggest that iconic scaffolding by means of sound symbolism plays an important role in early verb learning.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T24-4TKXDBT-2/2/48a46d41df6897f53f3466d877d8f102","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2008.07.015","ISSN":"0010-0277","author":[{"family":"Imai","given":"Mutsumi"},{"family":"Kita","given":"Sotaro"},{"family":"Nagumo","given":"Miho"},{"family":"Okada","given":"Hiroyuki"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,10]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2009",2,24]]}},

For example, I.S., a digit–colour synaesthete, experiences the colour green whenever he sees the digit 7. Since Galton's seminal report on synaesthesia [1], it has been a commonly held view that digit–colour synaesthesia is highly idiosyncratic: that is, the same inducer, for example, the digit 7, will evoke different experiences in different synaesthetes. Moreover, the assumption that inducer-concurrent relationships are random is rarely questioned [2] and is based mainly on comparing the salient components of the inducer and the resulting synaesthetic perception. In the case of digit–colour synaesthesia, for example, the name of the colour is compared with the name of the digit. Little or no attention has been paid to other components of the colour or digit, such as luminance, saturation, ordinality or cardinality, which are neither explicit nor cognitively penetrable to the synaesthete. Here we report evidence of a systematic organisation relating luminance and number magnitude in digit–colour synaesthesia. We found that this organisation is based on cardinality rather than ordinality and follows the Weber-Fechner law, which has been reported previously for numerical representation in humans and monkeys [3]. Our results challenge the underlying assumptions about the mechanisms underlying synaesthesia and its developmental trajectories, and the link between luminance level and numerical magnitude strongly supports the idea of a shared magnitude representation [4].","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982207017605","DOI":"10.1016/j.cub.2007.07.048","ISSN":"0960-9822","author":[{"family":"Cohen Kadosh","given":"Roi"},{"family":"Henik","given":"Avishai"},{"family":"Walsh","given":"Vincent"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,10,9]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",4,20]]},"container-title-short":"Current Biology"},

For example, color-grapheme synesthetes automatically perceive achromatic numbers as colored (e.g., 7 is turquoise). Although synesthetes know when a given color matches the one evoked by a certain number, colors do not automatically give rise to any sort of number experience. The behavioral consequences of synesthesia have been documented using Stroop-like paradigms, usually using color judgments. Owing to the unidirectional nature of the synesthetic experience, little has been done to obtain performance measures that could indicate whether bidirectional cross-activation occurs in synesthesia. Here it is shown that colors do implicitly evoke numerical magnitudes in color-grapheme synesthetes, but not in nonsynesthetic participants. It is proposed that bidirectional co-activation of brain areas is responsible for the links between color and magnitude processing in color-grapheme synesthesia and that unidirectional models of synesthesia might have to be revised.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/089892905774589181","DOI":"10.1162/089892905774589181","ISSN":"0898-929X","author":[{"family":"Kadosh","given":"Roi Cohen"},{"family":"Sagiv","given":"Noam"},{"family":"Linden","given":"David E.

In two naming experiments a digit-color synesthete showed that the congruity effect was modulated by number size.

In addition, the effect of color on her comparative judgments was modulated by numerical distance. In contrast, performance of non-synesthetes was not affected by the colors. On the basis of neurophysiological studies of magnitude comparison and interference between numerical and physical information, it is proposed that the interaction between colors and digits in MM occurs at the conceptual level.

We find that at least 6% (400/6588 participants) of the total sample learned many of their matches from a widely available colored letter toy. Among those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured, the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter-color pairings approaches 15% for some 5-year periods. Among those born 5 years or more before it was manufactured, none have colors learned from the toy. Analysis of the letter-color matching data suggests the only difference between synesthetes with matches to the toy and those without is exposure to the stimulus. These data indicate learning of letter-color pairings from external contingencies can occur in a substantial fraction of synesthetes, and are consistent with the hypothesis that grapheme-color synesthesia is a kind of conditioned mental imagery.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118996","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0118996","author":[{"family":"Witthoft","given":"Nathan"},{"family":"Winawer","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Eagleman","given":"David M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,3,4]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",5,29]]},"container-title-short":"PLoS ONE"},

Moreover, recently, ERP studies have shown that the sensitivity to sound-symbolic label-object associations occurs within 200 ms of object presentation (Kovic et al., 2010). It was argued that this effect may reflect a more general process of auditory-visual feature integration where properties of auditory stimuli facilitate a mapping to specific visual features. Here we demonstrate that the sound-symbolism effect is design dependent, namely — it occurs only when mapping from auditory to visual stimuli and not vice verse. Two groups of participants were recruited for solving the categorization task. They were presented them with 12 visual stimuli, half of which were rounded and another half of angular shapes. One group was trained to classify the rounded objects as `takete' and the rounded ones as `maluma', whereas the other group mapped `takete' to rounded and `maluma' to angular shapes. Moreover, half of these two groups heard the label before seeing the objects, whereas the other half was given the label after perceiving the object. The results revealed the sound-symbolism effect only in the group which was trained on the auditory-visual objects mapping and not in the one trained on the visual-auditory mappings. Thus, despite the previous findings we demonstrate that the sound-symbolism effect is not significant per se, but design-dependent and we argue that the sound brings up a mental image that is more constrained than the sounds brought up by a picture.","DOI":"10.1163/187847612X646866","author":[{"family":"Kovic","given":"Vanja"},{"family":"Pejovic","given":"Jovana"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"title-short":"Now you see it, now you dont"},

Previous studies with Japanese-speaking children, whose language defines a large grammatical class of words with clear sound symbolism, suggest that iconicity properties in Japanese may aid early verb learning, and a recent extended work suggests that such early sensitivity is not limited to children whose language supports such word classes. The present study further considers the use of sound-symbolic words in verb-learning context by conducting systematic cross-linguistic comparisons on early exposure to and effect of sound symbolism in verb mapping. Experiment 1 is an observational study of how English- and Japanese-speaking parents talk about verbs. More conventionalized symbolic words were found in Japanese-speaking parental input, and more idiosyncratic use of sound symbolism was found in English-speaking parental input. Despite this different exposure of iconic forms to describe actions, the artificial verb-learning task in Experiment 2 revealed that children in both language groups benefit from sound–meaning correspondences for their verb learning. These results together confirm more extensive use of conventionalized sound symbolism among Japanese speakers and also support a cross-linguistic consistency of the effect, which has been documented in the recent work. The work also points to the potential value of understanding the contexts in which sound–meaning correspondences matter in language learning.","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15248372.2011.573515","DOI":"10.1080/15248372.2011.573515","ISSN":"1524-8372","author":[{"family":"Yoshida","given":"Hanako"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",10,25]]}},

Of central interest was a hypothesized generalization process from synesthetic colors for graphemes, learned prior to acquisition of Kanji, to Kanji characters learned later. Results revealed that color choices for Kanji characters depend on meaning and phonological information. Some results suggested that colors are generalized from Hiragana characters and Arabic digits to Kanji characters via phonology and meaning, respectively.

However, this paper explores the role of iconicity, or non-arbitrary form-meaning mappings for both language processing and language acquisition. Evidence from signed language research is presented showing that sign language users exploit iconicity in language processing. Further, iconicity may be at work in language acquisition serving to bridge the gap between conceptual representations and linguistic form. Signed languages are taken as a starting point since they tend to encode a higher degree of iconic form-meaning mappings than is found for spoken languages, but the findings are more broadly applicable. Specifically, the emerging evidence argues against the dominant view that connections between linguistic form and meaning need be primarily arbitrary. Instead both arbitrariness and iconicity have a role to play in language.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-818X.2011.00301.x/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/j.1749-818X.2011.00301.x","ISSN":"1749-818X","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Thompson","given":"Robin L."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",6,12]]},"title-short":"Iconicity in Language Processing and Acquisition"},

The study used Hiragana and Katakana characters, which represent the same set of syllables although their visual forms are dissimilar. From a palette of 138 colors, synesthetes selected a color corresponding to each character. Results revealed that synesthetic color choices for Hiragana characters and those for their Katakana counterparts were remarkably consistent, indicating that color selection depended on character-related sounds and not visual form. This Hiragana–Katakana invariance cannot be regarded as the same phenomenon as letter case invariance, usually reported for English grapheme-color synesthesia, because Hiragana and Katakana characters have different identities whereas upper and lower case letters have the same identity. This involvement of phonology suggests that cross-activation between an inducer (i.e., letter/character) brain region and that of the concurrent (i.e., color) area in grapheme-color synesthesia is mediated by higher order cortical processing areas.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810011001450","DOI":"10.1016/j.concog.2011.05.012","ISSN":"1053-8100","author":[{"family":"Asano","given":"Michiko"},{"family":"Yokosawa","given":"Kazuhiko"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,12]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",5,29]]},"container-title-short":"Consciousness and Cognition"},

Patties were oven-cooked at 150 and 170°C and chill-stored for up to 5 days to facilitate warmed-over flavour development. Generalised Procrustes Analysis (GPA) was used to investigate sensory terms and their individual use by panellists over the sessions. GPA explained variance indicated that the final vocabulary displayed a similar amount of information to that of the initial vocabulary of 42 terms. Individual panellists scale use was found to converge over the sessions. Panel agreement on many odour and flavour terms appeared to be enhanced as term synonyms were removed in vocabulary development. Sample discriminability decreased from sessions 1–4, where term concepts were verbally communicated to the panel. Term reference introduction in session 5 caused a levelling in sample discriminability and a reduction in agreement, most likely related to perceptual confusion. Subsequently, references enhanced both discriminability and agreement.

Findings are considered from diverse subfields across the language sciences, including cognitive linguistics, psycholinguistics, linguistic anthropology, and conversation analysis. Taken together, it is clear that emotional expression is finely tuned to language-specific structures.

In the present study, we further explore these associations, using tastes and flavors solutions. Participants rated the stimuli on scales anchored by either non-words, taste descriptors, or other descriptors. The results confirm the existence of consistent crossmodal associations between tastes/flavors and words. Moreover, the results of principal components analysis suggest that these associations are likely based on the evaluation of the ‘hedonic value’ and ‘activity’ of the stimuli, two of the three dimensions first identified by Osgood (Psychol Bull 49:197–237, 1952 ), and since then repeatedly documented in the evaluation of a variety of sensory stimuli. The crossmodal associations elicited by non-words are particularly relevant for the naming/labelling of food products, since they might elicit expectations prior to consumption (and hence potentially be used to avoid any disconfirmation of expectation).","URL":"http://www.springerlink.com/content/l757tw1232568447/abstract/","DOI":"10.1007/s12078-012-9133-9","ISSN":"1936-5802","author":[{"family":"Crisinel","given":"Anne-Sylvie"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Spence","given":"Charles"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",9,12]]},"title-short":"‘The Sweet Taste of Maluma’"},

Language samples of nine children who received a CI between 5 and 19 months are analysed for linguistic measures representing different stages of language development. These include canonical babbling ratios, vocabulary diversity, and functional elements such as determiners. The results show that language development is positively related to the age at which children get first access to linguistic input and that later access to language is associated with a slower-than-normal language-learning rate.

An examination of literary texts shows that mimetics occur not only as the secondary element to another Co-event specifying form but also as the sole Co-event specifying element of the clause. As the latter, mimetics express Manner, Concomitance and Concurrent Result, i.e., three out of the eight relations a Co-event can have with the main Motion event (Talmy, 2000). This limited capability suggests that they are not the principal Co-event specifying form of Japanese. Nevertheless, they play an important role in Motion event descriptions as they: (i) supply indispensable lexical semantic information, being laden with rich meanings (e.g., rate in Manner) that parallel Basque movement imitatives (Ibarretxe-Antuñano, 2006); (ii) add nuances to a scene by combining with a diverse range of verbs/predicates, going beyond oft-cited collocational pairs such as yotiyoti aruku [toddling walk] `toddle'.","DOI":"10.1075/rcl.10.1.03tor","author":[{"family":"Toratani","given":"Kiyoko"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"title-short":"The role of sound-symbolic forms in Motion event descriptions","container-title-short":"Review of Cognitive Linguistics"},

The same strategies are also observed in the gestures of hearing nonsigners identifying pictures of the same set of tools. In this paper, we compare spontaneously created gestures from hearing nonsigning participants to commonly used lexical signs in ASL. Signers and gesturers were asked to respond to pictures of tools and to video vignettes of actions involving the same tools. Nonsigning gesturers overwhelmingly prefer the handling strategy for both the Picture and Video conditions. Nevertheless, they use more instrument forms when identifying tools in pictures, and more handling forms when identifying actions with tools. We found that ASL signers generally favor the instrument strategy when naming tools, but when describing tools being used by an actor, they are significantly more likely to use more handling forms. The finding that both gesturers and signers are more likely to alternate strategies when the stimuli are pictures or video suggests a common cognitive basis for differentiating objects from actions. Furthermore, the presence of a systematic handling/instrument iconic pattern in a sign language demonstrates that a conventionalized sign language exploits the distinction for grammatical purpose, to distinguish nouns and verbs related to tool use.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tops.12121/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/tops.12121","ISSN":"1756-8765","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Padden","given":"Carol"},{"family":"Hwang","given":"So-One"},{"family":"Lepic","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Seegers","given":"Sharon"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",4,29]]},"title-short":"Tools for Language","container-title-short":"Top Cogn Sci"},

A solution to the first pressure is combinatoriality — the recombination of a few basic meaningless forms to express an infinite number of meanings. A solution to the second is iconicity — the use of forms that resemble what they refer to. These two solutions appear to be incompatible with each other, as iconic forms are ill-suited for use as meaningless combinatorial units. Furthermore, in the early stages of a communication system, when basic referential forms are in the process of being established, the pressure for referential efficiency is likely to be particularly strong, which may lead it to trump the pressure for transmission efficiency. This means that, where iconicity is available as a strategy, it is likely to impede the emergence of combinatoriality. Although this hypothesis seems consistent with some observations of natural language, it was unclear until recently how it could be soundly tested. This has changed thanks to the development of a line of research, known as Experimental Semiotics, in which participants construct novel communication systems in the laboratory using an unfamiliar medium. We conducted an Experimental Semiotic study in which we manipulated the opportunity for iconicity by varying the kind of referents to be communicated, while keeping the communication medium constant. We then measured the combinatoriality and transmission efficiency of the communication systems. We found that, where iconicity was available, it provided scaffolding for the construction of communication systems and was overwhelmingly adopted. Where it was not available, however, the resulting communication systems were more combinatorial and their forms more efficient to produce. This study enriches our understanding of the fundamental design principles of human communication and contributes tools to enrich it further.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027715000724","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2015.04.001","ISSN":"0010-0277","author":[{"family":"Roberts","given":"Gareth"},{"family":"Lewandowski","given":"Jirka"},{"family":"Galantucci","given":"Bruno"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,8]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",4,30]]},"title-short":"How communication changes when we cannot mime the world","container-title-short":"Cognition"},

Growing evidence seems to support sound symbolism, claiming for a naturally constrained mapping of meaning into sounds. Most of such evidence, however, comes from studies based on the interpretation of pseudowords, and to date, there is little empirical evidence that sound symbolism can affect phonatory behavior. In the present study, we asked participants to utter the letter /a/ in response to visual stimuli varying in shape, luminance, and size, and we observed consistent sound symbolic effects on vocalizations. Utterances' loudness was modulated by stimulus shape and luminance. Moreover, stimulus shape consistently modulated the frequency of the third formant (F3). This finding reveals an automatic mapping of specific visual attributes into phonological features of vocalizations. Furthermore, it suggests that sound-meaning associations are reciprocal, affecting active (production) as well as passive (comprehension) linguistic behavior.","DOI":"10.1007/s00221-011-2836-3","ISSN":"1432-1106","author":[{"family":"Parise","given":"Cesare V."},{"family":"Pavani","given":"Francesco"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,10]]},"PMID":"21901453","container-title-short":"Exp Brain Res"},

We examined the influence of seeing the hammer or the keystroke on auditory temporal order judgments (TOJs). Participants judged the temporal order of a dog bark and a piano tone, while seeing the piano stroke shifted temporally relative to its audio signal. Visual lead increased “piano-first” responses in auditory TOJ, but more so if the associated keystroke was visible than if the sound-producing hammer was visible, even though both were equally visually salient. This provides evidence for a learning account of audiovisual perception.","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/PBR.17.3.329","DOI":"10.3758/PBR.17.3.329","ISSN":"1069-9384, 1531-5320","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Mitterer","given":"Holger"},{"family":"Jesse","given":"Alexandra"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,6,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",11,14]]},"container-title-short":"Psychonomic Bulletin & Review"},

Because adults and toddlers have had significant experience with the language mappings that exist in their environment, it is unclear whether the pairings are the result of language exposure or the product of an initial proclivity. We examined whether 4-month-old infants make the same sound–shape mappings as adults and toddlers. Four month-olds consistently distinguished between congruent and incongruent sound–shape mappings in a looking time task (Experiment 1). Furthermore, mapping was based on the combination of consonants and vowels in the words given that neither consonants (Experiment 2) nor vowels (Experiment 3) alone sufficed for mapping. Finally, we confirmed that adults also made systematic sound–shape mappings (Experiment 4); however, for adults, vowels or consonants alone sufficed.

A novel word-construction experiment is presented to test both proposed effects using randomized word- and image-generation techniques to address previous methodological concerns. Results show that participants are sensitive to both vowel and consonant content, constructing novel words of relatively sonorant consonants and rounded vowels to label curved object images, and of relatively plosive consonants and nonrounded vowels to label jagged object images.

Words in English often do convey some meaning through their sound as well as through the morphemes, as proponents have said; but the meaning is conveyed more systematically, abstractly and indirectly than they have allowed. Meaning in English is generally conveyed by conventionalised abstract symbols, as opponents have said; but “sound symbolism” is often truly symbolic, and symbols may be motivated in one respect while conventionalised in another. (Besides, English uses iconic and deictic/indexical means of expression, elsewhere than in sound.) The article seeks to resolve the controversy in two further ways.

However, little is known about the strategies used in demonstrating an action to an older child in comparison to another adult and without the use of objects, i.e., with gestures only. We tested if during demonstration of an action speakers use different degrees of iconicity in gestures for a child compared to an adult. 18 Italian subjects described to a camera how to make coffee imagining the listener as a 12-year-old child, a novice or an expert adult. While speech was found more informative both for the novice adult and for the child compared to the expert adult, the rate of iconic gestures increased and they were more informative and bigger only for the child compared to both of the adult conditions. Iconicity in gestures can be a powerful communicative strategy in teaching new knowledge to children in demonstrations and this is in line with claims that it can be used as a scaffolding device in grounding knowledge in experience (Perniss et al., 2010).","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216612003268","DOI":"10.1016/j.pragma.2012.12.007","ISSN":"0378-2166","author":[{"family":"Campisi","given":"Emanuela"},{"family":"Özyürek","given":"Asli"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,2]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",5,16]]},"title-short":"Iconicity as a communicative strategy","container-title-short":"Journal of Pragmatics"},

In Western societies, average to taller stature men and comparatively shorter, slimmer women have higher reproductive success and are typically considered more attractive. This size dimorphism also extends to vocalisations in many species, again including humans, with larger individuals exhibiting lower formant frequencies than smaller individuals. Further, across many languages there are associations between phonemes and the expression of size (e.g. large /a, o/, small /i, e/), consistent with the frequency-size relationship in vocalisations. We suggest that naming preferences are a product of this frequency-size relationship, driving male names to sound larger and female names smaller, through sound symbolism. In a 10-year dataset of the most popular British, Australian and American names we show that male names are significantly more likely to contain larger sounding phonemes (e.g. “Thomas”), while female names are significantly more likely to contain smaller phonemes (e.g. “Emily”). The desire of parents to have comparatively larger, more masculine sons, and smaller, more feminine daughters, and the increased social success that accompanies more sex-stereotyped names, is likely to be driving English-language first names to exploit sound symbolism of size in line with sexual body size dimorphism.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064825","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0064825","author":[{"family":"Pitcher","given":"Benjamin J."},{"family":"Mesoudi","given":"Alex"},{"family":"McElligott","given":"Alan G."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,6,5]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",6,11]]},"container-title-short":"PLoS ONE"},

One hypothesis is that Chinese characters might be coloured by their constituent morphological units, known as radicals, and we tested this by eliciting synaesthetic colours for characters while manipulating features of the radicals within them. We found that both the function (semantic vs. phonetic) and position (left vs. right) of radicals influence the nature of the synaesthetic colour generated.

Given that only a single stimulus was presented on each trial, these results rule out selective attention and multisensory integration as possible mechanisms underlying the reported compatibility effects on speeded performance. The crossmodal correspondences examined in the present study all gave rise to very similar effect sizes, and the compatibility effect had a very rapid onset, thus speaking to the automatic detection of crossmodal correspondences.

In particular, sound has a strong spatial connotation: Sounds are high and low, melodies rise and fall, and pitch systematically biases perceived sound elevation. The origins of such mappings are unknown. Are they the result of physiological constraints, do they reflect natural environmental statistics, or are they truly arbitrary? We recorded natural sounds from the environment, analyzed the elevation-dependent filtering of the outer ear, and measured frequency-dependent biases in human sound localization. We find that auditory scene statistics reveals a clear mapping between frequency and elevation. Perhaps more interestingly, this natural statistical mapping is tightly mirrored in both ear-filtering properties and in perceived sound location. This suggests that both sound localization behavior and ear anatomy are fine-tuned to the statistics of natural auditory scenes, likely providing the basis for the spatial connotation of human hearing.","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/16/6104","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1322705111","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Parise","given":"Cesare V."},{"family":"Knorre","given":"Katharina"},{"family":"Ernst","given":"Marc O."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,4,22]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",5,11]]},"PMID":"24711409","container-title-short":"PNAS"},

Multivariate analyses revealed that certain sound-meaning links (e.g., voicing and speed) were more consistent than others within and across languages. Language-specific sound symbolism was also found for some sound-meaning links (e.g., the affricate manner of articulation was associated with light motions in Japanese, but with heavy motions in English). This implies that cross-linguistically shared and language-specific parts of sound symbolism are intricately intertwined within each language.

While creative gestures are necessarily iconic, because they can be understood only thanks to their iconicity, codified gestures can be iconic too. A model for the generation of iconic gestures is presented, according to which, to create a new gesture, people select the features of the meaning to imitate in terms of their distinctiveness, ease of representation and ontological type. Finally, some principles for measuring the iconicity of gestures of Hearers and Signs of the Deaf are illustrated, thus outlining the continuity of iconic devices between creative and codified gestures.","DOI":"10.1075/gest.8.1.05pog","author":[{"family":"Poggi","given":"Isabella"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"container-title-short":"Gesture"},

Previous research has shown that sound symbolic words play facilitative role for preschool children’s novel verb learning, helping children identify what aspects of motion events should be mapped to verbs. In this research, we explore whether sound symbolism may facilitate language learning in human infants who have just begun to learn word meanings. Sound symbolism may be a useful cue particularly at the earliest stages of word learning, because this cue seems to be available without needing prior word learning experience. Using a habituation paradigm and a Bayesian model-based analysis, we demonstrated that 14-month-old infants could detect Köhler-type (1947) shape-sound symbolism, and could use this sensitivity in their effort to establish the word-referent association.","author":[{"family":"Miyazaki","given":"Michiko"},{"family":"Hidaka","given":"Shohei"},{"family":"Imai","given":"Mutsumi"},{"family":"Yeung","given":"H.

We tested whether sound symbolism only marks contrasts (e.g., small versus big things) or whether it marks object properties in a graded manner (e.g., small, medium, and large things). In two experiments, participants viewed novel objects (i.e., greebles) of varying size and chose the most appropriate name for each object from a list of visually or auditorily presented nonwords that varied incrementally in the number of “large” and “small” phonemes. For instance, “wodolo” contains all large-sounding phonemes, whereas “kitete” contains all small-sounding phonemes. Participants' choices revealed a graded relationship between sound and size: The size of the object linearly predicted the number of large-sounding phonemes in its preferred name.

However, in contrast to Westerners, the Himba did not map carbonation (in a sample of sparkling water) onto an angular (as opposed to a rounded) shape. Furthermore, they also tended to match less bitter (i.e., milk) chocolate samples to angular rather than rounded shapes; the opposite mapping to that shown by Westerners. Together, these results show that cultural–environmental as well as phylogenetic factors play a central role in shaping our repertoire of crossmodal correspondences.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027712002077","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2012.09.007","ISSN":"0010-0277","author":[{"family":"Bremner","given":"Andrew J."},{"family":"Caparos","given":"Serge"},{"family":"Davidoff","given":"Jules"},{"family":"Fockert","given":"Jan","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Linnell","given":"Karina J."},{"family":"Spence","given":"Charles"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,2]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,29]]},"title-short":"“Bouba” and “Kiki” in Namibia?","container-title-short":"Cognition"},

Despite this, educational performance in children with CI continues to lag behind their hearing peers. From animal models and human neuroimaging studies it has been proposed the integrative functions of auditory cortex are compromised by crossmodal plasticity. This has been argued to result partly from the use of a visual language. Here we argue that ‘cochlear implant sensitive periods’ comprise both auditory and language sensitive periods, and thus cannot be fully described with animal models. Despite prevailing assumptions, there is no evidence to link the use of a visual language to poorer CI outcome. Crossmodal reorganisation of auditory cortex occurs regardless of compensatory strategies, such as sign language, used by the deaf person. In contrast, language deprivation during early sensitive periods has been repeatedly linked to poor language outcomes. Language sensitive periods have largely been ignored when considering variation in CI outcome, leading to ill-founded recommendations concerning visual language in CI habilitation.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763413002017","DOI":"10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.08.011","ISSN":"0149-7634","author":[{"family":"Lyness","given":"C.R."},{"family":"Woll","given":"B."},{"family":"Campbell","given":"R."},{"family":"Cardin","given":"V."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,12]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",12,14]]},"container-title-short":"Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews"},

Synesthetes differ in the way synesthetic color is perceived: \"projector\" synesthetes experience color externally colocalized with a presented grapheme, whereas \"associators\" report an internally evoked association.

A functional magnetic resonance imaging study of synaesthetes and matched controls","container-title":"PloS One","page":"e12074","volume":"5","issue":"8","source":"PubMed","abstract":"BACKGROUND: In synaesthesia, sensations in a particular modality cause additional experiences in a second, unstimulated modality (e.g., letters elicit colour). Understanding how synaesthesia is mediated in the brain can help to understand normal processes of perceptual awareness and multisensory integration. In several neuroimaging studies, enhanced brain activity for grapheme-colour synaesthesia has been found in ventral-occipital areas that are also involved in real colour processing. Our question was whether the neural correlates of synaesthetically induced colour and real colour experience are truly shared.\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: First, in a free viewing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, we located main effects of synaesthesia in left superior parietal lobule and in colour related areas. In the left superior parietal lobe, individual differences between synaesthetes (projector-associator distinction) also influenced brain activity, confirming the importance of the left superior parietal lobe for synaesthesia. Next, we applied a repetition suppression paradigm in fMRI, in which a decrease in the BOLD (blood-oxygenated-level-dependent) response is generally observed for repeated stimuli. We hypothesized that synaesthetically induced colours would lead to a reduction in BOLD response for subsequently presented real colours, if the neural correlates were overlapping. We did find BOLD suppression effects induced by synaesthesia, but not within the colour areas.\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Because synaesthetically induced colours were not able to suppress BOLD effects for real colour, we conclude that the neural correlates of synaesthetic colour experience and real colour experience are not fully shared. We propose that synaesthetic colour experiences are mediated by higher-order visual pathways that lie beyond the scope of classical, ventral-occipital visual areas. Feedback from these areas, in which the left parietal cortex is likely to play an important role, may induce V4 activation and the percept of synaesthetic colour.","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0012074","ISSN":"1932-6203","language":"eng","author":[{"family":"Leeuwen","given":"Tessa M.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Petersson","given":"Karl Magnus"},{"family":"Hagoort","given":"Peter"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"PMID":"20711467","PMCID":"PMC2919410","title-short":"Synaesthetic colour in the brain","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE"},

Given these difficulties, the current literature now contains a number of conflicting assumptions about the nature of this condition. Here, I attempt to address several of these divisive areas from a set of contemporary definitions. I present evidence that might argue against previous claims that synaesthesia is (a) a ‘merging of the senses’, which (b) gives rise to consistent synaesthetic associations over time, with (c) synaesthetic associations that are spatially extended.

We investigated oscillatory brain signals of synesthetes vs. controls using magnetoencephalography. Brain oscillations specifically in the alpha band (∼10Hz) have two interesting features: alpha has been linked to inhibitory processes and can act as a marker for attention. The possible role of reduced inhibition as an underlying cause of synesthesia, as well as the precise role of attention in synesthesia is widely discussed. To assess alpha power effects due to synesthesia, synesthetes as well as matched controls viewed synesthesia-inducing graphemes, colored control graphemes, and non-colored control graphemes while brain activity was recorded. Subjects had to report a color change at the end of each trial which allowed us to assess the strength of synesthesia in each synesthete. Since color (synesthetic or real) might allocate attention we also included an attentional cue in our paradigm which could direct covert attention. In controls the attentional cue always caused a lateralization of alpha power with a contralateral decrease and ipsilateral alpha increase over occipital sensors. In synesthetes, however, the influence of the cue was overruled by color: independent of the attentional cue, alpha power decreased contralateral to the color (synesthetic or real). This indicates that in synesthetes color guides attention. This was confirmed by reaction time effects due to color, i.e. faster RTs for the color side independent of the cue. Finally, the stronger the observed color dependent alpha lateralization, the stronger was the manifestation of synesthesia as measured by congruency effects of synesthetic colors on RTs. Behavioral and imaging results indicate that color induces a location-specific, automatic shift of attention towards color in synesthetes but not in controls. We hypothesize that this mechanism can facilitate coupling of grapheme and color during the development of synesthesia.","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.06.024","ISSN":"1873-3514","language":"eng","author":[{"family":"Leeuwen","given":"Tessa M.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Hagoort","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Händel","given":"Barbara F."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,8]]},"PMID":"23831718","container-title-short":"Neuropsychologia"},

In this research, we explore whether sound symbolism may facilitate language learning in human infants who have just begun to learn word meanings.

More recently, graphics have been used to portray things that are metaphorically spatiovisual, like graphs and organizational charts. The assumption is that graphics can facilitate comprehension, learning, memory, communication and inference. Assumptions aside, research on static graphics has shown that only carefully designed and appropriate graphics prove to be beneficial for conveying complex systems. Effective graphics conform to the Congruence Principle according to which the content and format of the graphic should correspond to the content and format of the concepts to be conveyed. From this, it follows that animated graphics should be effective in portraying change over time. Yet the research on the efficacy of animated over static graphics is not encouraging. In cases where animated graphics seem superior to static ones, scrutiny reveals lack of equivalence between animated and static graphics in content or procedures; the animated graphics convey more information or involve interactivity. Animations of events may be ineffective because animations violate the second principle of good graphics, the Apprehension Principle, according to which graphics should be accurately perceived and appropriately conceived. Animations are often too complex or too fast to be accurately perceived. Moreover, many continuous events are conceived of as sequences of discrete steps. Judicious use of interactivity may overcome both these disadvantages. Animations may be more effective than comparable static graphics in situations other than conveying complex systems, for example, for real time reorientations in time and space.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581902910177","DOI":"10.1006/ijhc.2002.1017","ISSN":"1071-5819","author":[{"family":"Tversky","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Morrison","given":"Julie Bauer"},{"family":"Betrancourt","given":"Mireille"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,10]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",2,10]]},"title-short":"Animation","container-title-short":"International Journal of Human-Computer Studies"},

Many of these findings have been obtained across a range of different languages suggesting an internal relation between sublexical units and attributes as a potentially universal pattern.","URL":"http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00080/abstract","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00080","author":[{"family":"Schmidtke","given":"David S."},{"family":"Conrad","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Jacobs","given":"Arthur M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",2,19]]},"container-title-short":"Front.

We provide evidence from natural language in the form of sound symbolism, distinguishing conventional sound symbolism from sensory sound symbolism. Sensory sound symbolism, or the presence of iconicity in natural language, is considered alongside psychological experiments in naming, and other investigations of cross-modal associations specifically involving linguistic sound. This evidence supports the idea that we can directly express a variety of sensory experiences through linguistic sound, and thus that language systems have the capacity to be iconic to a large extent. We outline a theory of sensory protolanguage emergence, considering how and why arbitrariness eventually became the dominant relationship between form and meaning. Finally, we consider the possibility of continuity between cross-modal transfer in other primates and more abstract cross-modal associations among humans, suggesting this may have scaffolded the emergence of symbolic communication.","author":[{"family":"Cuskley","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Kirby","given":"Simon"}],"editor":[{"family":"Simner","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Hubbard","given":"Edward"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"publisher-place":"Oxford"},

Experiment 2 replicated this comparison with 4-year-olds. All ages successfully mapped iconic gestures. Eighteen-month-olds and 4-year-olds but not 26-month-olds mapped arbitrary gestures, revealing a U-shaped developmental function. These findings imply that (a) there is no advantage for iconicity in early symbol learning and (b) the range of symbols mapped becomes more restricted at 26 months, re-emerging more flexibly during the preschool years. We argue that the decline in arbitrary gesture learning is a function of developing appreciation of communicative conventions. We propose that the re-emergence of arbitrary gestures at 4 years is driven by a wider range of symbolic experiences, and enhanced sensitivity to others' communicative intent.","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327647jcd0501_3","DOI":"10.1207/s15327647jcd0501_3","ISSN":"1524-8372","author":[{"family":"Namy","given":"Laura L."},{"family":"Campbell","given":"Aimee L."},{"family":"Tomasello","given":"Michael"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,13]]},"title-short":"The Changing Role of Iconicity in Non-Verbal Symbol Learning"},

Two different dishabituation stimuli were then presented: audio /ba/-visual /va/ (perceived by adults as /va/), and audio /da/-visual /va/ (perceived by adults as /da/). The infants showed generalization from the audiovisual /va/ to the audio /ba/-visual /va/ stimulus but not to the audio /da/-visual /va/ stimulus.

On the one hand, these findings add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating that audiovisual correspondences can have perceptual (as well as decisional) effects. On the other hand, they prompt a question concerning their origin. Although the currently popular view is that crossmodal correspondences are based on the internalization of the natural multisensory statistics of the environment (see Spence, ), these new results suggest instead that certain correspondences may actually be based on the sensorimotor responses associated with human vocalizations. As such, the findings of Sweeny et al. help to breathe new life into Sapir's () once-popular “embodied” explanation of sound symbolism.

Though the principle generally holds across the lexicon, systematic exceptions have been identified. These “sound symbolic” forms have been identified in lexical items and linguistic processes in many individual languages. This paper examines sound symbolism in the languages of Australia. We conduct a statistical investigation of the evidence for several common patterns of sound symbolism, using data from a sample of 120 languages. The patterns examined here include the association of meanings denoting “smallness” or “nearness” with front vowels or palatal consonants, and the association of meanings denoting “largeness” or “distance” with back vowels or velar consonants. Our results provide evidence for the expected associations of vowels and consonants with meanings of “smallness” and “proximity” in Australian languages. However, the patterns uncovered in this region are more complicated than predicted. Several sound-meaning relationships are only significant for segments in prominent positions in the word, and the prevailing mapping between vowel quality and magnitude meaning cannot be characterized by a simple link between gradients of magnitude and vowel F2, contrary to the claims of previous studies.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0092852","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0092852","author":[{"family":"Haynie","given":"Hannah"},{"family":"Bowern","given":"Claire"},{"family":"LaPalombara","given":"Hannah"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,4,21]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,22]]},"container-title-short":"PLoS ONE"},

Their approach is based upon insights gained from adults who experience synesthesia, in whom sensory stimuli induce extra cross-modal or intramodal percepts. Synesthesia appears to represent one way that typical developmental mechanisms can play out by magnifying connections present in early life that are pruned and/or inhibited during development but persist in muted form in all adults. As such, the study of synesthesia provides valuable insights into the nature of intersensory development. The authors review evidence on the perceptual reality and neural basis of synesthesia, then summarize developmental models and evidence that its underlying mechanisms are universal in adults. They illustrate how evidence for consistent sensory associations in adults leads to predictions about toddlers' perception and present 3 bodies of work that have confirmed those hypotheses. They end by describing novel hypotheses about intersensory development that arise from this framework. Such intersensory associations appear to reflect intrinsic sensory cortical organization that influences the development of perception and of language and that may constrain the learning of environmentally based associations.","DOI":"10.1037/a0014171","ISSN":"1939-0599(Electronic);0012-1649(Print)","author":[{"family":"Spector","given":"Ferrinne"},{"family":"Maurer","given":"Daphne"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"title-short":"Synesthesia"},

In Experiment 2, we further examined the generalizability of the findings from Experiment 1 by testing another domain: shape mimetics. Our results show that the right posterior STS was active when subjects processed both motion and shape mimetic words, thus suggesting that this area may be the primary structure for processing sound symbolism.

Previously, we demonstrated a processing advantage when iconic properties of signs were made salient in a corresponding picture during a picture and sign matching task (Thompson, Vinson, & Vigliocco, 2009). The current study investigates the extent of iconicity effects with a phonological decision task (does the sign involve straight or curved fingers?) in which the meaning of the sign is irrelevant. The results show that iconicity is a significant predictor of response latencies and accuracy, with more iconic signs leading to slower responses and more errors. We conclude that meaning is activated automatically for highly iconic properties of a sign, and this leads to interference in making form-based decisions. Thus, the current study extends previous work by demonstrating that iconicity effects permeate the entire language system, arising automatically even when access to meaning is not needed.","DOI":"10.1037/a0019339","ISSN":"1939-1285(Electronic);0278-7393(Print)","author":[{"family":"Thompson","given":"Robin L."},{"family":"Vinson","given":"David P."},{"family":"Vigliocco","given":"Gabriella"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"title-short":"The link between form and meaning in British Sign Language"},

Cortical, thalamic, and brainstem neurons exhibited widespread 7- to 12-hertz synchronous oscillations, which began during attentive immobility and reliably predicted the imminent onset of rhythmic whisker twitching. Each oscillatory cycle began as a traveling wave of neural activity in the cortex that then spread to the thalamus. Just before the onset of rhythmic whisker twitching, the oscillations spread to the spinal trigeminal brainstem complex. Thereafter, the oscillations at all levels were synchronous with whisker protraction. Neural structures manifesting these rhythms also exhibited distributed spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal ensemble activity in response to tactile stimulation. Thus, multilevel synchronous activity in this system may encode not only sensory information but also the onset and temporal domain of tactile exploratory movements.","URL":"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/268/5215/1353","DOI":"10.1126/science.7761855","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Nicolelis","given":"M.

Synesthesia is widely considered a congenital condition, although an alternative view is that it is underpinned by repeated exposure to combined perceptual features at key developmental stages. Here we explore the potential for repeated associative learning to shape and engender synesthetic experiences. Non-synesthetic adult participants engaged in an extensive training regime that involved adaptive memory and reading tasks, designed to reinforce 13 specific letter-color associations. Following training, subjects exhibited a range of standard behavioral and physiological markers for grapheme-color synesthesia; crucially, most also described perceiving color experiences for achromatic letters, inside and outside the lab, where such experiences are usually considered the hallmark of genuine synesthetes. Collectively our results are consistent with developmental accounts of synesthesia and illuminate a previously unsuspected potential for new learning to shape perceptual experience, even in adulthood.","URL":"http://www.nature.com/srep/2014/141118/srep07089/full/srep07089.html#affil-auth","DOI":"10.1038/srep07089","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Bor","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Rothen","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Schwartzman","given":"David J."},{"family":"Clayton","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Seth","given":"Anil K."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,11,18]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",12,19]]},"container-title-short":"Sci.

Here, using three Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based measures of brain activity, we establish that preverbal 11-month-old infants are sensitive to the non-arbitrary correspondences between language sounds and concepts, that is, to sound symbolism. In each trial, infant participants were presented with a visual stimulus (e.g., a round shape) followed by a novel spoken word that either sound-symbolically matched (“moma”) or mismatched (“kipi”) the shape. Amplitude increase in the gamma band showed perceptual integration of visual and auditory stimuli in the match condition within 300 msec of word onset. Furthermore, phase synchronization between electrodes at around 400 msec revealed intensified large-scale, left-hemispheric communication between brain regions in the mismatch condition as compared to the match condition, indicating heightened processing effort when integration was more demanding. Finally, event-related brain potentials showed an increased adult-like N400 response – an index of semantic integration difficulty – in the mismatch as compared to the match condition. Together, these findings suggest that 11-month-old infants spontaneously map auditory language onto visual experience by recruiting a cross-modal perceptual processing system and a nascent semantic network within the first year of life.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945214002883","DOI":"10.1016/j.cortex.2014.08.025","ISSN":"0010-9452","author":[{"family":"Asano","given":"Michiko"},{"family":"Imai","given":"Mutsumi"},{"family":"Kita","given":"Sotaro"},{"family":"Kitajo","given":"Keiichi"},{"family":"Okada","given":"Hiroyuki"},{"family":"Thierry","given":"Guillaume"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,2]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,28]]},"container-title-short":"Cortex"},

Data have mainly been taken from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family in which the origin of onomatopoeic expressions, as well as sound symbolic clusters, or phonaesthemes, can be traced historically to Proto-Germanic and Proto-Indo-European. Two main types of motivated connections between expression and content are distinguished: iconic and indexical. Iconic connections basically embrace onomatopoeic expression, in which there is an attempt towards creating a likeness between the sound created by the content and the linguistic form of the expression. These types of motivated expressions behave differently from the indexical, even though the boundaries to some extent are floating. Phonaesthemes are regarded as predominantly indexically motivated and analysed synchronically in the Germanic languages, in which there is considerable agreement on the meaning connected to some of them, e.g. fl-, gl-, bl- which are connected to light and similar semantic associations. Other phonaesthemes, such as fj-, are restricted to individual languages only. The all-Germanic phonaesthemes are traced back historically as well as into reconstructed stages of the proto-language, and the origin of words and groups of words are taken into consideration. The later phonaesthemes, occurring in individual languages only, are traced back historically, taking older sources and first occurrences into consideration. The study shows that a number of different mechanisms of change, both on the form and the meaning side, are involved when sound symbolic clusters grow in a language. This shows that the general principles of change are disrupted or distorted by synchronically operative linguistic mechanisms, involving iconicity and indexicality. Finally, motivated language change is compared to other similar changes such as analogical change, and the consequences for the classification of various types of iconicity are discussed.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03740463.2014.990293","DOI":"10.1080/03740463.2014.990293","ISSN":"0374-0463","author":[{"family":"Carling","given":"Gerd"},{"family":"Johansson","given":"Niklas"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,7,3]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,25]]},"title-short":"Motivated language change"},

Across the four groups of participants, the results revealed a number of crossmodal correspondences between certain colors/shapes and bitter, sour, and sweet tastes. Crossmodal correspondences were also documented between the color white and smooth/rough textures on the one hand and the salt taste on the other. Cross-cultural differences were observed in the correspondences between certain colors, shapes, and one of the textures and the taste terms. The taste-patterns shown by the participants from the four countries tested in the present study are quite different from one another, and these differences cannot easily be attributed merely to whether a country is Eastern or Western.

Sound symbolism may be a useful cue particularly at the earliest developmental stages of word learning, because it potentially provides a way of bootstrapping word meaning from perceptual information. Using an associative word learning paradigm, we demonstrated that 14-month-old infants could detect Köhler-type (1947) shape-sound symbolism, and could use this sensitivity in their effort to establish a word-referent association.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0116494","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0116494","author":[{"family":"Imai","given":"Mutsumi"},{"family":"Miyazaki","given":"Michiko"},{"family":"Yeung","given":"H.

A well-known example is the Bouba/Kiki effect, in which nonwords like bouba are associated with round shapes while nonwords like kiki are associated with sharp shapes. These sound symbolic associations have thus far been limited to nonwords. Here we tested whether or not the Bouba/Kiki effect extends to existing lexical stimuli; in particular, real first names. We found that the roundness/sharpness of the phonemes in first names impacted whether the names were associated with round or sharp shapes in the form of character silhouettes (Experiments 1a and 1b). We also observed an association between femaleness and round shapes, and maleness and sharp shapes. We next investigated whether this association would extend to the features of language and found the proportion of round-sounding phonemes was related to name gender (Analysis of Category Norms). Finally, we investigated whether sound symbolic associations for first names would be observed for other abstract properties; in particular, personality traits (Experiment 2). We found that adjectives previously judged to be either descriptive of a figuratively ‘round’ or a ‘sharp’ personality were associated with names containing either round- or sharp-sounding phonemes, respectively. These results demonstrate that sound symbolic associations extend to existing lexical stimuli, providing a new example of non-arbitrary mappings between form and meaning.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126809","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0126809","author":[{"family":"Sidhu","given":"David M."},{"family":"Pexman","given":"Penny M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,27]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",7,15]]},"title-short":"What’s in a Name?","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE"},

Yet, we know little about how people create vocal communication systems, and many have suggested that vocalizations do not afford iconicity beyond trivial instances of onomatopoeia. It is unknown whether people can generate vocal communication systems through a process of iconic creation similar to gestural systems. Here, we examine the creation and development of a rudimentary vocal symbol system in a laboratory setting. Pairs of participants generated novel vocalizations for 18 different meanings in an iterative ‘vocal’ charades communication game. The communicators quickly converged on stable vocalizations, and naive listeners could correctly infer their meanings in subsequent playback experiments. People's ability to guess the meanings of these novel vocalizations was predicted by how close the vocalization was to an iconic ‘meaning template’ we derived from the production data. These results strongly suggest that the meaningfulness of these vocalizations derived from iconicity. Our findings illuminate a mechanism by which iconicity can ground the creation of vocal symbols, analogous to the function of iconicity in gestural communication systems.","URL":"http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/2/8/150152","DOI":"10.1098/rsos.150152","ISSN":"2054-5703","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Perlman","given":"Marcus"},{"family":"Dale","given":"Rick"},{"family":"Lupyan","given":"Gary"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,8,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,7]]}},

Recent gesture elicitation studies have indicated that constituent order (corresponding to for instance subject–verb–object, or SVO in English) may be heavily influenced by human cognitive biases constraining gesture production and transmission. Here we explore the alternative hypothesis that syntactic patterns are motivated by multiple environmental and social–interactional constraints that are external to the cognitive domain. In three experiments, we systematically investigate different motivations for structure in the gestural communication of simple transitive events. The first experiment indicates that, if participants communicate about different types of events, manipulation events (e.g. someone throwing a cake) and construction events (e.g. someone baking a cake), they spontaneously and systematically produce different constituent orders, SOV and SVO respectively, thus following the principle of structural iconicity. The second experiment shows that participants’ choice of constituent order is also reliably influenced by social–interactional forces of interactive alignment, that is, the tendency to re-use an interlocutor’s previous choice of constituent order, thus potentially overriding affordances for iconicity. Lastly, the third experiment finds that the relative frequency distribution of referent event types motivates the stabilization and conventionalization of a single constituent order for the communication of different types of events. Together, our results demonstrate that constituent order in emerging gestural communication systems is shaped and stabilized in response to multiple external environmental and social factors: structural iconicity, interactive alignment and distributional frequency.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027715300615","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2015.09.004","ISSN":"0010-0277","author":[{"family":"Christensen","given":"Peer"},{"family":"Fusaroli","given":"Riccardo"},{"family":"Tylén","given":"Kristian"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,28]]},"title-short":"Environmental constraints shaping constituent order in emerging communication systems","container-title-short":"Cognition"},

It is well established that humans form systematic cross-modal correspondences between stimulus features that can facilitate the accurate combination of sensory percepts. However, the evolutionary origins of the perceptual and cognitive mechanisms involved in these cross-modal associations remain surprisingly underexplored. In this review we outline recent comparative studies investigating how non-human mammals naturally combine information encoded in different sensory modalities during communication. The results of these behavioural studies demonstrate that various mammalian species are able to combine signals from different sensory channels when they are perceived to share the same basic features, either because they can be redundantly sensed and/or because they are processed in the same way. Moreover, evidence that a wide range of mammals form complex cognitive representations about signallers, both within and across species, suggests that animals also learn to associate different sensory features which regularly co-occur. Further research is now necessary to determine how multisensory representations are formed in individual animals, including the relative importance of low level feature-related correspondences. Such investigations will generate important insights into how animals perceive and categorise their environment, as well as provide an essential basis for understanding the evolution of multisensory perception in humans.","URL":"http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/22134808-00002509","DOI":"10.1163/22134808-00002509","ISSN":"2213-4808","author":[{"family":"Ratcliffe","given":"Victoria F."},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Anna M."},{"family":"Reby","given":"David"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,13]]}},

A general principle of brand name design is that effective names should be distinctive, recognizable, easy to pronounce and meaningful. Much money is invested in designing powerful brand names, where the emotional impact of the names on consumers is also relevant and it is important to avoid negative connotations. Customers prefer brand names, which say something about the product, as this reduces product uncertainty (Klink, 2001). Therefore, consumers might prefer sound symbolic names. It has been shown that people associate the sounds of the nonsense words maluma and takete with round and angular shapes, respectively. By extension, more complex shapes and textures might activate words containing certain sounds. This study focuses on semantic dimensions expected to be relevant to product names, such as mobility, consistency, texture and shape. These dimensions are related to the senses of sight, hearing and touch and are also interesting from a cognitive linguistic perspective. Cross-modal assessment and priming experiments with pictures and written words were performed and the results analysed in relation to brand name databases and to sound symbolic sound combinations in Swedish (Abelin, 1999). The results show that brand names virtually never contain pejorative, i.e. depreciatory, consonant clusters, and that certain sounds and sound combinations are overrepresented in certain content categories. Assessment tests show correlations between pictured objects and phoneme combinations in newly created words (non-words). The priming experiment shows that object images prime newly created words as expected, based on the presence of compatible consonant clusters.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215039015000028","DOI":"10.1016/j.amper.2014.12.001","ISSN":"2215-0390","author":[{"family":"Abelin","given":"Åsa"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,27]]},"container-title-short":"Ampersand"},

In certain instances, sound symbolism can allow non-native speakers to understand the meanings of etymologically unfamiliar foreign words, although the mechanisms driving this are not well understood. We examined whether sound symbolism might be mediated by the same types of cross-modal processes that typify synaesthetic experiences. Synaesthesia is an inherited condition in which sensory or cognitive stimuli (e.g., sounds, words) cause additional, unusual cross-modal percepts (e.g., sounds trigger colours, words trigger tastes). Synaesthesia may be an exaggeration of normal cross-modal processing, and if so, there may be a link between synaesthesia and the type of cross-modality inherent in sound symbolism. To test this we predicted that synaesthetes would have superior understanding of unfamiliar (sound symbolic) foreign words. In our study, 19 grapheme-colour synaesthetes and 57 non-synaesthete controls were presented with 400 adjectives from 10 unfamiliar languages and were asked to guess the meaning of each word in a two-alternative forced-choice task. Both groups showed superior understanding compared to chance levels, but synaesthetes significantly outperformed controls. This heightened ability suggests that sound symbolism may rely on the types of cross-modal integration that drive synaesthetes’ unusual experiences. It also suggests that synaesthesia endows or co-occurs with heightened multi-modal skills, and that this can arise in domains unrelated to the specific form of synaesthesia.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027714002339","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2014.11.013","ISSN":"0010-0277","author":[{"family":"Bankieris","given":"Kaitlyn"},{"family":"Simner","given":"Julia"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,3]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,26]]},"container-title-short":"Cognition"},

This test was repeated after a three-week interval. In their responses, which were not as temporally consistent as those of grapheme–colour synaesthetes, participants showed biases and regularities that were comparable to those of synaesthetes reported in past studies. Although it has been believed that only synaesthetes, and not nonsynaesthetes, tended to associate graphemes with colours based on grapheme frequency, Berlin and Kay's colour typology, and colour word frequency, participants in this study tended in part to associate graphemes with colours based on the above factors. Moreover, participants that were nonsynaesthetes tended to associate different graphemes that shared sounds and/or meanings (e.g., Arabic and kanji numerals representing the same number) with the same colours, which was analogous to the findings in Japanese synaesthetes.

The potato chips were perceived as being both crisper and fresher when either the overall sound level was increased, or when just the high frequency sounds (in the range of 2 kHz−20 kHz) were selectively amplified. These results highlight the significant role that auditory cues can play in modulating the perception and evaluation of foodstuffs (despite the fact that consumers are often unaware of the influence of such auditory cues). The paradigm reported here also provides a novel empiric methodology for assessing such multisensory contributions to food perception.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-459x.2004.080403.x/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/j.1745-459x.2004.080403.x","ISSN":"1745-459X","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Zampini","given":"Massimiliano"},{"family":"Spence","given":"Charles"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,10,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",11,12]]}},

Incorporating iconic elements of language into a compositional semantics faces a number of challenges in formal frameworks as evidenced by the lengthy literature in linguistics and philosophy on quotation/direct speech, which iconically portrays the words of another in the form that they were used. This paper compares the well-studied type of iconicity found with verbs of quotation with another form of iconicity common in sign languages: classifier predicates. I argue that these two types of verbal iconicity can, and should, incorporate their iconic elements in the same way using event modification via the notion of a context dependent demonstration. This unified formal account of quotation and classifier predicates predicts that a language might use the same strategy for conveying both, and I argue that this is the case with role shift in American Sign Language. Role shift is used to report others’ language and thoughts as well as their actions, and recently has been argued to provide evidence in favor of Kaplanian “monstrous” indexical expressions. By reimagining role shift as involving either (i) quotation for language demonstrations or (ii) “body classifier” predicates for action demonstrations, the proposed account eliminates one major argument for these monsters coming from sign languages. Throughout this paper, sign languages provide a fruitful perspective for studying quotation and other forms of iconicity in natural language due to their (i) lack of a commonly used writing system which is otherwise often mistaken as primary data instead of speech, (ii) the rich existing literature on iconicity within sign language linguistics, and (iii) the ability of role shift to overtly mark the scope of a language report. In this view, written language is merely a special case of a more general phenomenon of sign and speech demonstration, which accounts more accurately for natural language data by permitting more strict or loose verbatim interpretations of demonstrations through the context dependent pragmatics.","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10988-015-9180-1","DOI":"10.1007/s10988-015-9180-1","ISSN":"0165-0157, 1573-0549","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Davidson","given":"Kathryn"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,11,26]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,18]]},"container-title-short":"Linguist and Philos"},

Although only a small proportion of the population is synesthetic, there is growing evidence to suggest that neurocognitively-normal individuals also experience some form of synesthetic association between the stimuli presented to different sensory modalities (i.e., between auditory pitch and visual size, where lower frequency tones are associated with large objects and higher frequency tones with small objects). While previous research has highlighted crossmodal interactions between synesthetically corresponding dimensions, the possible role of synesthetic associations in multisensory integration has not been considered previously.\n\nMethodology\nHere we investigate the effects of synesthetic associations by presenting pairs of asynchronous or spatially discrepant visual and auditory stimuli that were either synesthetically matched or mismatched. In a series of three psychophysical experiments, participants reported the relative temporal order of presentation or the relative spatial locations of the two stimuli.\n\nPrincipal Findings\nThe reliability of non-synesthetic participants' estimates of both audiovisual temporal asynchrony and spatial discrepancy were lower for pairs of synesthetically matched as compared to synesthetically mismatched audiovisual stimuli.\n\nConclusions\nRecent studies of multisensory integration have shown that the reduced reliability of perceptual estimates regarding intersensory conflicts constitutes the marker of a stronger coupling between the unisensory signals. Our results therefore indicate a stronger coupling of synesthetically matched vs. mismatched stimuli and provide the first psychophysical evidence that synesthetic congruency can promote multisensory integration. Synesthetic crossmodal correspondences therefore appear to play a crucial (if unacknowledged) role in the multisensory integration of auditory and visual information.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005664","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0005664","author":[{"family":"Parise","given":"Cesare Valerio"},{"family":"Spence","given":"Charles"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,5,27]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,10]]},"title-short":"‘When Birds of a Feather Flock Together’","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE"},

For mate attraction, signals are typically similar to attractive environmental cues like food [ 3–6 ], which amplifies their attractiveness to mates, as opposed to aversive stimuli like predator cues. Female field crickets approach the low-frequency calling song of males, whereas they avoid high-frequency sounds like predatory bat calls [ 7 ]. In one group of crickets (Eneopterinae: Lebinthini), however, males produce exceptionally high-frequency calling songs in the range of bat calls [ 8 ], a surprising signal in the context of mate attraction. We found that female lebinthines, instead of approaching singing males, produce vibrational responses after male calls, and males track the source of vibrations to find females. We also demonstrate that field cricket species closely related to the Lebinthini show an acoustic startle response to high-frequency sounds that generates substrate vibrations similar to those produced by female lebinthine crickets. Therefore, the startle response is the most likely evolutionary origin of the female lebinthine vibrational signal. In field crickets, the brain receives activity from two auditory interneurons; AN1 tuned to male calling song controls positive phonotaxis, and AN2 tuned to high-frequency bat calls triggers negative phonotaxis [ 9, 10 ]. In lebinthine crickets, however, we found that auditory ascending neurons are only tuned to high-frequency sounds, and their tuning matches the thresholds for female vibrational signals. Our results demonstrate how sensory exploitation of anti-predator behavior can evolve into a communication system that benefits both senders and receivers.","URL":"http://www.cell.com/article/S0960982215013585/abstract","DOI":"10.1016/j.cub.2015.10.064","ISSN":"0960-9822","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Hofstede","given":"Hannah M.","non-dropping-particle":"ter"},{"family":"Schöneich","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Robillard","given":"Tony"},{"family":"Hedwig","given":"Berthold"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,12]]}},

The purpose of this article is to establish if the same directionality also holds for synaesthetic associations found in other text types. To this end, a method for the semi-automatic extraction of synaesthesia is introduced and applied to general-purpose corpora of English (ukWaC) and Italian (itWaC). In the data collected for these languages, most transfers proceed in the expected direction, e.g. sweet voice, but instances of ‘backward’ transfers are also found, e.g. bitter cold. Based on these results, it is claimed that the ‘directionality principle’ reflects the frequency of association types, rather than representing universal constraints on synaesthetic transfers, as has often been more or less explicitly assumed. It is here argued that both properties of human perception and more strictly linguistic factors can account for the frequency tendencies observed in synaesthesia. The proposed interpretation is also shown to account for apparently contradictory evidence coming from typological studies on verbs of perception.","DOI":"10.1075/fol.22.1.04str","author":[{"family":"Strik Lievers","given":"Francesca"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,1]]},"title-short":"Synaesthesia","container-title-short":"Functions of Language"},

How such combinatorial structure emerged in the evolution of human language is increasingly being studied. It has been shown that it can emerge when languages culturally evolve and adapt to human cognitive biases. How the emergence of combinatorial structure interacts with the existence of holistic iconic form-meaning mappings in a language is still unknown. The experiment presented in this paper studies the role of iconicity and human cognitive learning biases in the emergence of combinatorial structure in artificial whistled languages. Participants learned and reproduced whistled words for novel objects with the use of a slide whistle. Their reproductions were used as input for the next participant, to create transmission chains and simulate cultural transmission. Two conditions were studied: one in which the persistence of iconic form-meaning mappings was possible and one in which this was experimentally made impossible. In both conditions, cultural transmission caused the whistled languages to become more learnable and more structured, but this process was slightly delayed in the first condition. Our findings help to gain insight into when and how words may lose their iconic origins when they become part of an organized linguistic system.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.12326/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/cogs.12326","ISSN":"1551-6709","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Verhoef","given":"Tessa"},{"family":"Kirby","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Boer","given":"Bart","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,12,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,4]]},"container-title-short":"Cogn Sci"},

Several recent studies have demonstrated cross-modal associations (or correspondences) between sounds and gustatory sensations by asking participants to match predefined sound-symbolic words (e.g., “maluma/takete”) with the taste/texture of foods. Here, we further explore cross-modal associations using the spontaneous production of words and semantic ratings of sensations. In the experiment, after drinking liquids, participants were asked to express their taste/texture using Japanese sound-symbolic words, and at the same time, to evaluate it in terms of criteria expressed by adjectives. Because the Japanese language has a large vocabulary of sound-symbolic words, and Japanese people frequently use them to describe taste/texture, analyzing a variety of Japanese sound-symbolic words spontaneously produced to express taste/textures might enable us to explore the mechanism of taste/texture categorization. A hierarchical cluster analysis based on the relationship between linguistic sounds and taste/texture evaluations revealed the structure of sensation categories. The results indicate that an emotional evaluation like pleasant/unpleasant is the primary cluster in gustation.","URL":"http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/12/28/chemse.bjv078","DOI":"10.1093/chemse/bjv078","ISSN":"0379-864X, 1464-3553","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Sakamoto","given":"Maki"},{"family":"Watanabe","given":"Junji"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,12,28]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,4]]},"PMID":"26715523","title-short":"Cross-Modal Associations between Sounds and Drink Tastes/Textures","container-title-short":"Chem.

A common type of synesthesia is grapheme–color synesthesia, in which the visual perception of letters and numbers stimulates the perception of a specific color. Previous studies have often collected relatively small numbers of grapheme–color associations per synesthete, but the accumulation of a large quantity of data has greater promise for uncovering the mechanisms underlying synesthetic association. In this study, we therefore collected large samples of data from a total of eight synesthetes. All told, we obtained over 1000 synesthetic colors associated with Japanese kanji characters from each of two synesthetes, over 100 synesthetic colors form each of three synesthetes, and about 80 synesthetic colors associated with Japanese hiragana, Latin letters, and Arabic numerals from each of three synesthetes. We then compiled the data into a database, called the KANJI-Synesthetic Colors Database (K-SCD), which has a total of 5122 colors for 483, 46, and 46 Japanese kanji, hiragana, and katakana characters, respectively, as well as for 26 Latin letters and ten Arabic numerals. In addition to introducing the K-SCD, this article demonstrates the database’s merits by using two examples, in which two new rules for synesthetic association, “shape similarity” and “synesthetic color clustering,” were found. The K-SCD is publicly accessible (www.​cv.​jinkan.​kyoto-u.​ac.​jp/​site/​uploads/​K-SCD.​xlsm) and will be a valuable resource for those who wish to conduct statistical analyses using a rich dataset in order to uncover the rules governing synesthetic association and to understand its mechanisms.","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-015-0691-z","DOI":"10.3758/s13428-015-0691-z","ISSN":"1554-3528","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Hamada","given":"Daisuke"},{"family":"Yamamoto","given":"Hiroki"},{"family":"Saiki","given":"Jun"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,7]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,12]]},"container-title-short":"Behav Res"},

We carried out a questionnaire-based comprehensibility test with 245 Japanese noun phrases. Each phrase consists of an adjective and a noun from seven modalities (temperature, touch, smell, taste, shape, color, sound). Our results show the following three points concerning synaesthetic phrases in Japanese, (i) the modality of temperature is distinguished from that of touch, and temperature is located at the left end of the scale in the model of directionality; (ii) the modality of shape is separable from color, and its position in the model of directionality is closer to touch than to color; (iii) the modality of taste does not become the target of extension from higher modalities like sound or color, and color does not become the source of extension to lower modalities like touch, taste, and smell.

An evolutionary stance appears to provide support for linguistic nativism, because coordinated constraints on variation may facilitate communication and therefore be adaptive. However, language, like many other human behaviors, is underpinned by social learning and cultural transmission alongside biological evolution. We set out two models of these interactions, which show how culture can facilitate rapid biological adaptation yet rule out strong nativization. The amplifying effects of culture can allow weak cognitive biases to have significant population-level consequences, radically increasing the evolvability of weak, defeasible inductive biases; however, the emergence of a strong cultural universal does not imply, nor lead to, nor require, strong innate constraints. From this we must conclude, on evolutionary grounds, that the strong nativist hypothesis for language is false. More generally, because such reciprocal interactions between cultural and biological evolution are not limited to language, nativist explanations for many behaviors should be reconsidered: Evolutionary reasoning shows how we can have cognitively driven behavioral universals and yet extreme plasticity at the level of the individual—if, and only if, we account for the human capacity to transmit knowledge culturally. Wherever culture is involved, weak cognitive biases rather than strong innate constraints should be the default assumption.","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/03/30/1523631113","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1523631113","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Thompson","given":"Bill"},{"family":"Kirby","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Kenny"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,4]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",4,5]]},"PMID":"27044094","container-title-short":"PNAS"},

A comparison of a reconstructed Proto-Indo-European deictic system (based mainly on Beekes, Comparative Indo-European Linguistics: An Introduction, 1995) compared with the systems of attested Indo-European languages makes it clear that both systems and forms have undergone change, may it be through sound change, analogy, and/or semantic change. Based on the assumptions by Ultan (Universals of Human Language 2, Phonology, 1978), Woodworth (1991), Traunmüller (Tongues and Texts Unlimited. Studies in Honour of Tore Jansson on the Occasion of his Sixtieth Anniversary, 1994), and Johansson and Zlatev (Motivations for Sound Symbolism in Spatial Deixis: A Typological Study of 101 languages. The Public Journal of Semiotics, 2013), iconicity obviously plays a role in the synchronic systems of spatial deixis, which in turn indicates the iconicity has played a role on the process of change, both of the forms themselves and the systems as such. Data from 13 contemporary and 17 historical languages, belonging to 12 Indo-European branches was used. Vowels and consonants were divided into voiceless sounds as being more proximal, and voiced sounds being more distal (see the explanation below). The voiced sounds were divided according to the frequency of their f2, with [i] and voiced palatal consonants as more proximal and [u] as more distal (Ohala, Sound Symbolism, 1994). Results were divided into motivated (fulfilling the expected relation between deictic form and sound value), non-motivated (arbitrary), and reversed-motivated (the reverse of motivated). Five strategies of rebuilding deictic systems and forms were identified. None of the languages investigated have used a system identical to the Proto-Indo-European reconstructed system. Mostly internal material from the Proto-Indo-European deictic system was used in the forms of the systems of the daughter languages. Generally, a statistically significant motivated support was found: 70.2% of the forms of the languages used were identified as motivated, 9.2–10.4% were non-motivated and 19.4–20.7% reversed-motivated. Due to the different strategies of rebuilding systems and forms, generative explanations for the motivated support should be excluded. Hence, iconicity seemed to be reintroduced after the decay, by means of language change, of a former (motivated) deictic system. Therefore, it turned out as a very likely conclusion that iconicity has been and is involved in the rebuilding of deictic material, relating to the systems as such.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03740463.2015.1006830","DOI":"10.1080/03740463.2015.1006830","ISSN":"0374-0463","author":[{"family":"Johansson","given":"Niklas"},{"family":"Carling","given":"Gerd"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,2]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,9]]}},

Nevertheless, it is unclear how embodied action, mental imagery and iconicity influence their acquisition of signed language. The current study examines the impact of these factors on sign acquisition by manipulating how signs are learned, as well as their semantic and phonological relatedness. The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated that American Sign Language (ASL) signs are learned more effectively via enactment than via referent visualisation and meaningless hand motion, and that iconic signs are learned more effectively than other types of signs. The results of Experiment 2 demonstrate that, when learned via enactment, semantically related ASL signs are recalled more accurately than phonologically related ASL signs. These results indicate that hearing adults' sign language acquisition can be enhanced via a learning method that combines mental imagery and meaningful embodied action (i.e., enactment), strengthening connections between the forms of signs and their referents.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20445911.2014.999684","DOI":"10.1080/20445911.2014.999684","ISSN":"2044-5911","author":[{"family":"Morett","given":"Laura M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,4,3]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",5,10]]},"title-short":"Lending a hand to signed language acquisition"},

Over the intervening years, many other researchers have agreed—at the very least, implicitly—with this position (e.g., Bien, ten Oever, Goebel, & Sack NeuroImage 59:663–672, 2012; Eagleman Cortex 45:1266–1277, 2009; Esterman, Verstynen, Ivry, & Robertson Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 18:1570–1576, 2006; Ludwig, Adachi, & Matzuzawa Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 108:20661–20665, 2011; Mulvenna & Walsh Trends in Cognitive Sciences 10:350–352, 2006; Sagiv & Ward 2006; Zellner, McGarry, Mattern-McClory, & Abreu Chemical Senses 33:211–222:2008). Here, though, we defend the separatist view, arguing that these cases are likely to form distinct kinds of phenomena despite their superficial similarities. We believe that crossmodal correspondences should be studied in their own right and not assimilated, either in terms of the name used or in terms of the explanation given, to synesthesia. To conflate these two phenomena is both inappropriate and potentially misleading. Below, we critically evaluate the evidence concerning the descriptive and constitutive features of crossmodal correspondences and synesthesia and highlight how they differ. Ultimately, we wish to provide a general definition of crossmodal correspondences as acquired, malleable, relative, and transitive pairings between sensory dimensions and to provide a framework in which to integrate the nonsystematic cataloguing of new cases of crossmodal correspondences, a tendency that has increased in recent years.","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-013-0387-2","DOI":"10.3758/s13423-013-0387-2","ISSN":"1069-9384, 1531-5320","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Deroy","given":"Ophelia"},{"family":"Spence","given":"Charles"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,2,15]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",5,12]]},"container-title-short":"Psychon Bull Rev"},

While the anatomical substrates underlying this experience are well understood, little research to date has investigated factors influencing the particular colors associated with particular graphemes or how synesthesia occurs developmentally. A recent suggestion of such an interaction has been proposed in the cascaded cross-tuning (CCT) model of synesthesia, which posits that in synesthetes connections between grapheme regions and color area V4 participate in a competitive activation process, with synesthetic colors arising during the component-stage of grapheme processing. This model more directly suggests that graphemes sharing similar component features (lines, curves, etc.) should accordingly activate more similar synesthetic colors. To test this proposal, we created and regressed synesthetic color-similarity matrices for each of 52 synesthetes against a letter-confusability matrix, an unbiased measure of visual similarity among graphemes. Results of synesthetes’ grapheme–color correspondences indeed revealed that more similarly shaped graphemes corresponded with more similar synesthetic colors, with stronger effects observed in individuals with more intense synesthetic experiences (projector synesthetes). These results support the CCT model of synesthesia, implicate early perceptual mechanisms as driving factors in the elicitation of synesthetic hues, and further highlight the relationship between conceptual and perceptual factors in this phenomenon.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393211000042","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.01.002","ISSN":"0028-3932","author":[{"family":"Brang","given":"David"},{"family":"Rouw","given":"Romke"},{"family":"Ramachandran","given":"V.

In contrast, proficient ASL–English bilinguals exhibited slower recognition and translation times for iconic signs. We suggest iconicity aids memorisation in the early stages of adult sign language learning, but for fluent L2 signers, iconicity interacts with other variables that slow translation (specifically, the iconic signs had more translation equivalents than the noniconic signs).

There was a correspondence between the colors experienced for written graphemes and their manual counterparts, suggesting that the development of these two types of synesthesia is interdependent despite the fact that these systems are superficially distinct and rely on different perceptual recognition mechanisms in the brain.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13554794.2016.1198489","DOI":"10.1080/13554794.2016.1198489","ISSN":"1355-4794","author":[{"family":"Atkinson","given":"Joanna"},{"family":"Lyons","given":"Tanya"},{"family":"Eagleman","given":"David"},{"family":"Woll","given":"Bencie"},{"family":"Ward","given":"Jamie"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,28]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",7,2]]},"PMID":"27351751"},

  {"id":"winter_sensory_2016","type":"thesis","title":"The Sensory Structure of the English Lexicon","publisher":"University of California, Merced","genre":"PhD dissertation","source":"escholarship.org","abstract":"Language vividly connects to the world around us by encoding sensory information. For example, the words fragrant and silky evoke smell and touch, whereas hazy , beeping and salty evoke vision, hearing and taste. This dissertation shows that the sensory modality that a word evokes is highly predictive of a word’s linguistic behavior in a way that supports embodied cognition theories. That is, perceptual differences between the senses result in linguistic differences, and interrelations in perception result in interrelations in language. Chapter 3 provides evidence that the English language exhibits visual dominance, with visual words such as bright , purple and shiny being more frequent, less contextually restricted and more semantically complex. These linguistic patterns are argued to follow from the perceptual dominance of vision. Chapters 4 and 5 show that taste, smell and touch words form an affectively loaded part of the English lexicon. It is argued that the precise way in which these sensory words engage in emotional language follows from how the corresponding senses are tied to emotional processes in perception and in the brain. Chapter 6 addresses phonological differences between classes of sensory words, arguing that tactile and auditory words are particularly prone to sound symbolism. A look at tactile sound symbolism reveals that “r is for rough”, with many words for rough surfaces ( bristly , prickly , abrasive ) containing the sound /r/. Chapters 7 and 8 look at how sensory words can be combined with each other. In particular, these chapters address the question: Why is it that touch and taste adjectives ( soft , sweet ) are those most likely to be used to describe other sensory impressions ( soft color , sweet sound )? And why is it that auditory adjectives ( loud , squealing , muffled ) are not used much at all in comparable expressions? It is shown that whether or not a word can be used in such so-called “synesthetic metaphors” is partly due to the affective dimension of language, and partly due to frequency and sound symbolism: Highly frequent and affective words with little sound symbolism are most likely to occur in metaphors. Together, the empirical analyses presented throughout the chapters of this dissertation provide a quantitative description of English sensory words that ultimately leads to a view of the English lexicon as thoroughly embodied, with profuse connections between language and sensory perception.","URL":"http://escholarship.org/uc/item/885849k9","author":[{"family":"Winter","given":"Bodo"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",6,28]]},"publisher-place":"Merced"},

Here we ask how can the idea that synaesthesia reflects innate, genetic differences be reconciled with models that suggest it is driven by learning. A number of lines of evidence suggest that synaesthesia relies on, or at least interacts with, processes of multisensory integration that are common across all people. These include multisensory activations that arise in early regions of the brain as well as feedback from longer-term cross-modal associations generated in memory. These cognitive processes may interact independently to influence the phenomenology of the synaesthetic experience, as well as the individual differences within particular types of synaesthesia. The theoretical framework presented here is consistent with both an innate difference as the fundamental driver of the condition of synaesthesia, and with experiential and semantic influences on the eventual phenotype that emerges. In particular, it proposes that the internally generated synaesthetic percepts are treated similarly to other sensory information as the brain is learning the multisensory attributes of objects and developing cross-modal associations that merge in the concept of the object.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393215301111","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.07.026","ISSN":"0028-3932","author":[{"family":"Newell","given":"Fiona N."},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Kevin J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,29]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",7,26]]},"title-short":"Multisensory integration and cross-modal learning in synaesthesia","container-title-short":"Neuropsychologia"},

Conventional wisdom has held that this occurs extremely rarely (0.05% of births) and affects women more than men. Here we present the first test of synaesthesia prevalence with sampling that does not rely on self-referral, and which uses objective tests to establish genuineness. We show that (a) the prevalence of synaesthesia is 88 times higher than previously assumed, (b) the most common variant is coloured days, (c) the most studied variant (grapheme - colour synaesthesia)—previously believed most common—is prevalent at 1%, and (d) there is no strong asymmetry in the distribution of synaesthesia across the sexes.

Here, we investigate how such phoneme clusters that potentially serve as sublexical markers of affect can influence language processing. We registered the EEG signal during a lexical decision task with a novel manipulation of the words' putative sublexical affective potential: the means of valence and arousal values for single phoneme clusters, each computed as a function of respective values of words from the database these phoneme clusters occur in. Our experimental manipulations also investigate potential contributions of formal salience to the sublexical affective potential: Typically, negative high-arousing phonological segments—based on our calculations—tend to be less frequent and more structurally complex than neutral ones. We thus constructed two experimental sets, one involving this natural confound, while controlling for it in the other. A negative high-arousing sublexical affective potential in the strictly controlled stimulus set yielded an early posterior negativity (EPN), in similar ways as an independent manipulation of lexical affective content did. When other potentially salient formal features at the sublexical level were not controlled for, the effect of the sublexical affective potential was strengthened and prolonged (250–650 ms), presumably because formal salience helps making specific phoneme clusters efficient sublexical markers of negative high-arousing affective meaning. These neurophysiological data support the assumption that the organization of a language's vocabulary involves systematic sound-to-meaning correspondences at the phonemic level that influence the way we process language.","URL":"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01200/full","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01200","author":[{"family":"Ullrich","given":"Susann"},{"family":"Kotz","given":"Sonja A."},{"family":"Schmidtke","given":"David S."},{"family":"Aryani","given":"Arash"},{"family":"Conrad","given":"Markus"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",8,20]]},"title-short":"Phonological Iconicity Electrifies","container-title-short":"Phonological Iconicity"},

While synaesthesia and crossmodal correspondences may differ regarding the degree of vividness, frequency, specificity of the conscious manifestation, and control over its content, we demonstrate that these dimensions fail to lead to the expected continuous distribution.

Cross-modal correspondences refer to universal associations between seemingly unrelated sensory features, e.g., auditory pitch and visual size. Some argue that these phenomena form a continuum, with classical synesthesia being an exaggeration of universal cross-modal correspondences, whereas others contend that the two are quite different, since cross-modal correspondences are non-arbitrary, non-idiosyncratic, and do not involve secondary experiences. Here, we used the implicit association test to compare synesthetes’ and non-synesthetes’ sensitivity to cross-modal correspondences. We tested the associations between auditory pitch and visual elevation, auditory pitch and visual size, and sound-symbolic correspondences between auditory pseudowords and visual shapes. Synesthetes were more sensitive than non-synesthetes to cross-modal correspondences involving sound-symbolic, but not low-level sensory, associations. We conclude that synesthesia heightens universally experienced cross-modal correspondences, but only when these involve sound symbolism. This is only partly consistent with the idea of a continuum between synesthesia and cross-modal correspondences, but accords with the idea that synesthesia is a high-level, post-perceptual phenomenon, with spillover of the abilities of synesthetes into domains outside their synesthesias. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that synesthetes, relative to non-synesthetes, experience stronger cross-modal correspondences outside their synesthetic domains.

In this study, we investigated implicit associative learning in synesthetes and nonsynesthetes by recording reaction times to a target whose color was probabilistically correlated with its shape. A continuous measure of target detection at multiple time points during learning revealed that synesthetes and nonsynesthetes learn associations differently. Specifically, our results demonstrated a “fast-facilitation” learning effect for nonsynesthetes and a “fast-interference, slow-facilitation” learning effect for synesthetes. Additionally, synesthetes exhibited superior long-term memory for the learned associations in a surprise delayed retest. After this retest, participants implicitly learned new (shuffled) shape–color associations. We found that synesthetes experienced greater interference while learning these new shape–color associations. These results detail ways in which implicit associative learning and memory differ between synesthetes and nonsynesthetes.","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-016-1162-y","DOI":"10.3758/s13423-016-1162-y","ISSN":"1069-9384, 1531-5320","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Bankieris","given":"Kaitlyn R."},{"family":"Aslin","given":"Richard N."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,9]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,14]]},"container-title-short":"Psychon Bull Rev"},
  {"id":"anible_iconicity_2016","type":"thesis","title":"Iconicity effects in translation direction: Bimodal bilingual lexical processing","source":"repository.unm.edu","abstract":"Second language learners of American Sign Language (ASL) have an unusual preference for translating “forward” into their second language (Nicodemus & Emmorey 2013), in contrast to spoken language bilinguals’ preference for translating “backward” into their first language (Seleskovich, 1976). The typical bilingual preference for backward lexical translation is modeled by Kroll and Stewart (1994) who showed that forward translation uses slower conceptual mediation and backward translation uses faster lexical mediation, but this asymmetry alone fails to explain signed language bilinguals’ forward preference. Prior attempts to explain these conflicting patterns for signing vs. non-signing bilinguals based on the prevalence of iconicity in signed languages are inconclusive (Bosworth & Emmorey 2010, Thompson et al. 2009, 2010). However, these failed to distinguish between language-external (transparency and imageability) and language-internal (iconicity) motivated form-meaning mappings. This dissertation investigates whether language-external and language-internal motivated mappings between form and meaning differentially impact conceptual and lexical activation during translation. \n\nStudy 1 revisits translation recognition experiments (Talamas et al. 1999, Sunderman & Kroll, 2006) in which participants judge lexical items from two languages and decide if they are equivalent. Results show incorrect translation distractors that are related in both form and meaning to the correct translation inhibit recognition in both novices and experts; however, they parallel semantic distractors for novices, but phonological distractors for experts. Further, language-external conceptual imageability affects novices and experts in a similar manner for unrelated distractors, but not for iconic distractors. Study 2 investigates the interaction of proficiency, imageability, and iconicity during production in forward and backward translation. While both imageability and iconicity facilitate forward translation for novices, they do not facilitate backward translation. Experts, on the other hand, show no facilitation for either measure in forward translation, but do benefit from iconicity in backward translation. \n\nIn sum, this dissertation provides evidence that language external motivations facilitate conceptual access for novice learners of signed languages and language internal motivations grow in importance with proficiency. This dynamic explains the unusual preference of spoken/signed bilinguals for forward translation at lower levels of proficiency and provides support for a cognitive usage-based model of the bimodal bilingual lexicon.","URL":"http://repository.unm.edu/handle/1928/33002","language":"en_US","author":[{"family":"Anible","given":"Benjamin"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,25]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,19]]},"title-short":"Iconicity effects in translation direction"},

Previous studies have found that particular sounds can be associated with particular meanings, and also with particular static visual shapes. Less well studied is the association between sounds and dynamic movements. Using a free elicitation method, the current experiment shows that several sound symbolic associations between sounds and dynamic movements exist: (1) front vowels are more likely to be associated with small movements than with large movements; (2) front vowels are more likely to be associated with angular movements than with round movements; (3) obstruents are more likely to be associated with angular movements than with round movements; (4) voiced obstruents are more likely to be associated with large movements than with small movements. All of these results are compatible with the results of the previous studies of sound symbolism using static images or meanings. Overall, the current study supports the hypothesis that particular dynamic motions can be associated with particular sounds. Building on the current results, we discuss a possible practical application of these sound symbolic associations in sports instructions.","URL":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0163525","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0163525","ISSN":"1932-6203","author":[{"family":"Shinohara","given":"Kazuko"},{"family":"Yamauchi","given":"Naoto"},{"family":"Kawahara","given":"Shigeto"},{"family":"Tanaka","given":"Hideyuki"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,28]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,29]]},"title-short":"Takete and Maluma in Action","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE"},

Comparing across eight sign languages (American, Japanese, German, Israeli, and Kenyan Sign Languages, Ha Noi Sign Language of Vietnam, Central Taurus Sign Language of Turkey, and Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language of Israel) and the gestures of American non-signers, we find recurring patterns for naming entities in three semantic categories (tools, animals, and fruits & vegetables). These recurring patterns are captured in a classification system that identifies iconic strategies based on how the body is used together with the hands. Across all groups, tools are named with manipulation forms, where the head and torso represent those of a human agent. Animals tend to be identified with personification forms, where the body serves as a map for a comparable non-human body. Fruits & vegetables tend to be identified with object forms, where the hands act independently from the rest of the body to represent static features of the referent. We argue that these iconic patterns are rooted in using the body for communication, and provide a basis for understanding how meaningful communication emerges quickly in gesture and persists in emergent and established sign languages.","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/language-and-cognition/article/of-the-body-and-the-hands-patterned-iconicity-for-semantic-categories/4744C46A08EAD70E25AB2957AF6A0C1C","DOI":"10.1017/langcog.2016.28","ISSN":"1866-9808, 1866-9859","author":[{"family":"Hwang","given":"So-One"},{"family":"Tomita","given":"Nozomi"},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Hope"},{"family":"Ergin","given":"Rabia"},{"family":"İlkbaşaran","given":"Deniz"},{"family":"Seegers","given":"Sharon"},{"family":"Lepic","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Padden","given":"Carol"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",11,15]]},"title-short":"Of the body and the hands"},

Here, we ask further whether different types of iconic depictions modulate children's preferences for certain types of sign-referent links during vocabulary development in sign language. Results from a picture description task indicate that lexical signs with 2 possible variants are used in different proportions by deaf signers from different age groups. While preschool and school-age children favored variants representing actions associated with their referent (e.g., a writing hand for the sign PEN), adults preferred variants representing the perceptual features of those objects (e.g., upward index finger representing a thin, elongated object for the sign PEN). Deaf parents interacting with their children, however, used action- and perceptual-based variants in equal proportion and favored action variants more than adults signing to other adults. We propose that when children are confronted with 2 variants for the same concept, they initially prefer action-based variants because they give them the opportunity to link a linguistic label to familiar schemas linked to their action/motor experiences. Our results echo findings showing a bias for action-based depictions in the development of iconic co-speech gestures suggesting a modality bias for such representations during development.

Current debates focus on a range of pre-conditions for the emergence of language, including co-operation and related mentalising capacities, imitation and tool use, episodic memory, and vocal physiology, but little specifically on the ability to learn and understand symbols. It is argued here that such a focus raises new questions about the plausibility of gesture-first hypotheses, and so about the evolution of language in general. After a brief review of the methodology used in the article, it is argued that existing uses of gesture in hominid communities may have prohibited the emergence of symbol use, rather than ‘bootstrapped’ symbolic capacities as is usually assumed, and that the vocal channel offers other advantages in both learning and using language. In this case, the vocal channel offers a more promising platform for the evolution of language than is often assumed.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mila.12102/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/mila.12102","ISSN":"1468-0017","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Irvine","given":"Elizabeth"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,7]]},"title-short":"Method and Evidence","container-title-short":"Mind Lang"},

This study investigated whether sound symbolic properties correspond to specific meanings, or whether these properties generalize across semantic dimensions. In three experiments, native English-speaking adults heard sound symbolic foreign words for dimensional adjective pairs (big/small, round/pointy, fast/slow, moving/still) and for each foreign word, selected a translation among English antonyms that either matched or mismatched with the correct meaning dimension. Listeners agreed more reliably on the English translation for matched relative to mismatched dimensions, though reliable cross-dimensional mappings did occur.

Contrary to our prediction, native speakers of Czech (transparent) were more likely to be synaesthetes than native speakers of English (opaque). However, exploratory analyses suggested that this was because more Czechs learned non-native second languages, which was strongly associated with synaesthesia, consistent with the learning hypothesis.

By providing on-line clues to the location and duration of upcoming syllables, temporal structure may aid segmentation and clustering of continuous speech into separable units. This hypothesis tacitly assumes that learners exploit predictability in the temporal structure of speech. Existing measures of speech timing tend to focus on first-order regularities among adjacent units, and are overly sensitive to idiosyncrasies in the data they describe. Here, we compare several statistical methods on a sample of 18 languages, testing whether syllable occurrence is predictable over time. Rather than looking for differences between languages, we aim to find across languages (using clearly defined acoustic, rather than orthographic, measures), temporal predictability in the speech signal which could be exploited by a language learner. First, we analyse distributional regularities using two novel techniques: a Bayesian ideal learner analysis, and a simple distributional measure. Second, we model higher-order temporal structure – regularities arising in an ordered series of syllable timings – testing the hypothesis that non-adjacent temporal structures may explain the gap between subjectively-perceived temporal regularities, and the absence of universally-accepted lower-order objective measures. Together, our analyses provide limited evidence for predictability at different time scales, though higher-order predictability is difficult to reliably infer. We conclude that temporal predictability in speech may well arise from a combination of individually weak perceptual cues at multiple structural levels, but is challenging to pinpoint.","URL":"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00586/abstract","DOI":"10.3389/fnhum.2016.00586","ISSN":"1662-5161","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Jadoul","given":"Yannick"},{"family":"Ravignani","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Bill"},{"family":"Filippi","given":"Piera"},{"family":"Boer","given":"Bart","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,17]]},"title-short":"Seeking Temporal Predictability in Speech","container-title-short":"Front.

To examine the role of sound symbolic effects on processing and memory for nonwords, we developed a novel set of 100 nonwords to convey largeness (nonwords containing plosive consonants and back vowels) and smallness (nonwords containing fricative consonants and front vowels). In Experiments 1A and 1B, participants rated the size of the 100 nonwords and provided definitions to them as if they were products. Nonwords composed of fricative/front vowels were rated as smaller than those composed of plosive/back vowels. In Experiment 2, participants studied sound symbolic congruent and incongruent nonword and participant-generated definition pairings. Definitions paired with nonwords that matched the size and participant-generated meanings were recalled better than those that did not match. When the participant-generated definitions were re-paired with other nonwords, this mnemonic advantage was reduced, although still reliable. In a final free association study, the possibility that plosive/back vowel and fricative/front vowel nonwords elicit sound symbolic size effects due to mediation from word neighbors was ruled out. Together, these results suggest that definitions that are sound symbolically congruent with a nonword are more memorable than incongruent definition-nonword pairings.

We present two new experiments with two different databases and with novel analyses to give a detailed quantification of how iconicity contributes to vocabulary acquisition across development, including both receptive understanding and production. The results demonstrate that iconicity is more prevalent early in acquisition and diminishes with increasing age and with increasing vocabulary. In the first experiment, we found that the influence of iconicity on children’s production vocabulary decreased gradually with increasing age. These effects were independent of the observed influence of concreteness, difficulty of articulation, and parental input frequency. Importantly, we substantiated the independence of iconicity, concreteness, and systematicity--a statistical regularity between sounds and meanings. In the second experiment, we found that the average iconicity of both a child's receptive and expressive vocabulary diminished dramatically with increases in vocabulary size. These results indicate that iconic words tend to be learned early in the acquisition of both receptive and expressive vocabulary. We recommend that iconicity be included as one of the many different influences on a child’s early vocabulary acquisition.","URL":"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fcomm.2017.00004/abstract","DOI":"10.3389/fcomm.2017.00004","ISSN":"2297-900X","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Massaro","given":"Dominic W."},{"family":"Perlman","given":"Marcus"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",3,10]]},"title-short":"Quantifying Iconicity’s Contribution during Language Acquisition","container-title-short":"Front.

In the present study, we focus on iconicity in language, that is, resemblance relationships between form and meaning, and on non-ostensive contexts, where label and referent do not co-occur. We approach the question of language learning from the perspective of the language input. Specifically, we look at child-directed language (CDL) in British Sign Language (BSL), a language rich in iconicity due to the affordances of the visual modality. We ask whether child-directed signing exploits iconicity in the language by highlighting the similarity mapping between form and referent. We find that CDL modifications occur more often with iconic signs than with non-iconic signs. Crucially, for iconic signs, modifications are more frequent in non-ostensive contexts than in ostensive contexts. Furthermore, we find that pointing dominates in ostensive contexts, and suggest that caregivers adjust the semiotic resources recruited in CDL to context. These findings offer first evidence for a role of iconicity in the language input and suggest that iconicity may be involved in referential mapping and language learning, particularly in non-ostensive contexts.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12551/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/desc.12551","ISSN":"1467-7687","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Perniss","given":"Pamela"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Jenny C."},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Gary"},{"family":"Vigliocco","given":"Gabriella"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",3,16]]},"title-short":"Mapping language to the world","container-title-short":"Dev Sci"},

In addition, many species map one-dimensional quantities across sensory modalities, such as conspecific faces to voices, or high-pitched sounds to bright light. If basic patterns like repetitions and identities are frequently perceived in different sensory modalities, it could be advantageous to detect cross-modal isomorphisms, i.e. develop modality-independent representations of structural features, exploitable in visual, tactile, and auditory processing. While cross-modal mappings are common in the animal kingdom, the ability to map similar (isomorphic) structures across domains has been demonstrated in humans but no other animals. We tested cross-modal isomorphisms in two chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Individuals were previously trained to choose structurally ‘symmetric’ image sequences (two identical geometrical shapes separated by a different shape) presented beside ‘edge’ sequences (two identical shapes preceded or followed by a different one). Here, with no additional training, the choice between symmetric and edge visual sequences was preceded by playback of three concatenated sounds, which could be symmetric (mimicking the symmetric structure of reinforced images) or edge. The chimpanzees spontaneously detected a visual-auditory isomorphism. Response latencies in choosing symmetric sequences were shorter when presented with (structurally isomorphic) symmetric, rather than edge, sound triplets: The auditory stimuli interfered, based on their structural properties, with processing of the learnt visual rule. Crucially, the animals had neither been exposed to the acoustic sequences before the experiment, nor were they trained to associate sounds to images. Our result provides the first evidence of structure processing across modalities in a non-human species. It suggests that basic cross-modal abstraction capacities transcend linguistic abilities and might involve evolutionary ancient neural mechanisms.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027717300057","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2017.01.005","ISSN":"0010-0277","author":[{"family":"Ravignani","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Sonnweber","given":"Ruth"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",3,23]]},"container-title-short":"Cognition"},

In this paper, we introduce a pattern of pluractionality in sign language, via reduplication of verbal forms. We focus on the semantics of two pluractional markers that appear pervasively in French Sign Language (LSF): exact repetition (/‑rep/) and two‑handed alternating repetition (/‑alt/). We show that /‑rep/ and /‑alt/ fit into a larger typology of pluractionality in (spoken) language, where pluractional morphology specifies distribution over various dimensions. Additionally, however, the LSF pattern shows several novel properties. First, we observe a compositional puzzle, wherein the pluractional morphemes appear to be trivially redundant when they appear under distributive operators. Taking inspiration from work on ‘dependent indefinites’ in the nominal domain, we propose an analysis in which pluractional markers are scope‑taking predicates, that are licensed by distributive operators by taking scope over them. Second, we show that the rate of reduplication for both forms is iconically mapped to the rate of event repetition over time. We show that this iconic mapping is an at‑issue entailment that must be able to interact with logical meaning throughout the composition of a sentence. We propose an integrated model, in which pluractional morphemes incorporate an iconically defined predicate. In the context of our compositional system, this proposal makes the novel prediction of ‘scopable iconicity,’ in which the iconic meaning can be evaluated at different structural positions.\n\nEARLY ACCESS","URL":"http://semprag.org/article/view/sp.10.6","DOI":"10.3765/sp.10.6","ISSN":"1937-8912","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Kuhn","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Aristodemo","given":"Valentina"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,30]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",4,3]]}},

To serve the aim, the current research conducts a test, using a multiple-choice task in which groups of native English and Korean speakers choose the meanings of phonaesthemes in sets of aurally-presented nonsense English phonaesthemic words. If primary iconicity is carried by a phonaestheme, then both native and non-native listeners should be able to report with some consistency the putative meaning of the nonsense phonaesthemic words. If, on the other hand, a form-meaning correspondence is carried by secondary iconicity (where the existence of the sign-relation, given by convention or by being explicitly pointed out, is the precondition for noticing the similarity between sign and referent [Sonesson, 1997]), then neither language group is expected to deliver high correct guessing rates. The result showed that the purported meanings of sk- and tw- were correctly guessed by the Korean-speaking participants only, and those of cl-, gl-, sw-, gr-, sn-, and sq- were correctly guessed by the English-speaking participants only.

We used a validated test to diagnose grapheme–colour synaesthesia. Results show a significantly higher prevalence of synaesthesia in people with ASC, but only those who also have savant skills.

However, in case of ambiguity the brain has to decide whether to combine or segregate sensory inputs. We hypothesise that widespread, subtle forms of synesthesia provide crossmodal mapping patterns which underlie and influence multisensory perception. Our aim was to investigate if such a mechanism plays a role in the case of pitch-size stimulus combinations. Using a combination of psychophysics and ERPs, we could show that despite violations of spatial correspondence, the brain specifically integrates certain stimulus combinations which are congruent with respect to our hypothesis of pitch-size synesthesia, thereby impairing performance on an auditory spatial localisation task (Ventriloquist effect). Subsequently, we perturbed this process by functionally disrupting a brain area known for its role in multisensory processes, the right intraparietal sulcus, and observed how the Ventriloquist effect was abolished, thereby increasing behavioural performance. Correlating behavioural, TMS and ERP results, we could retrace the origin of the synesthestic pitch-size mappings to a right intraparietal involvement around 250 ms. The results of this combined psychophysics, TMS and ERP study provide evidence for shifting the current viewpoint on synesthesia more towards synesthesia being at the extremity of a spectrum of normal, adaptive perceptual processes, entailing close interplay between the different sensory systems. Our results support this spectrum view of synesthesia by demonstrating that its neural basis crucially depends on normal multisensory processes.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811911007683","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.06.095","ISSN":"1053-8119","author":[{"family":"Bien","given":"Nina"},{"family":"Oever","given":"Sanne","non-dropping-particle":"ten"},{"family":"Goebel","given":"Rainer"},{"family":"Sack","given":"Alexander T."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,1,2]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",4,18]]},"title-short":"The sound of size","container-title-short":"NeuroImage"},

One suggestion, proposed in the current study, to explain the spectrum of symptoms is an underlying impairment in multisensory integration (MSI) systems such as a mirror neuron-like system. The mirror neuron system, thought to play a critical role in skills such as imitation, empathy, and language can be thought of as a multisensory system, converting sensory stimuli into motor representations. Consistent with this, we report preliminary evidence for deficits in a task thought to tap into MSI—“the bouba-kiki task” in children with ASD. The bouba-kiki effect is produced when subjects are asked to pair nonsense shapes with nonsense “words”. We found that neurotypical children chose the nonsense “word” whose phonemic structure corresponded with the visual shape of the stimuli 88% of the time. This is presumably because of mirror neuron-like multisensory systems that integrate the visual shape with the corresponding motor gestures used to pronounce the nonsense word. Surprisingly, individuals with ASD only chose the corresponding name 56% of the time. The poor performance by the ASD group on this task suggests a deficit in MSI, perhaps related to impaired MSI brain systems. Though this is a behavioral study, it provides a testable hypothesis for the communication impairments in children with ASD that implicates a specific neural system and fits well with the current findings suggesting an impairment in the mirror systems in individuals with ASD.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17470910701563681","DOI":"10.1080/17470910701563681","ISSN":"1747-0919","author":[{"family":"Oberman","given":"Lindsay M."},{"family":"Ramachandran","given":"Vilayanur S."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,9,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",5,4]]},"PMID":"18979385","title-short":"Preliminary evidence for deficits in multisensory integration in autism spectrum disorders"},

Synaesthetes experiencing colours for words show better memory than matched controls for stimuli that induce synaesthesia (word lists) relative to stimuli that do not (an abstract figure). However, memory advantages are not limited to material that elicits synaesthesia because synaesthetes demonstrate enhanced memory for colour per se (which does not induce a synaesthetic response). Our results suggest that the memory enhancement found in synaesthetes is related to an enhanced retention of colour in both synaesthetic and nonsynaesthetic situations.

Using two classic crossmodal integration tasks we show that grapheme-color synesthetes exhibit enhanced crossmodal interactions between auditory and visual modalities, suggesting that the experience of synesthesia in one modality generalizes to enhanced crossmodal processes with other modalities. This finding supports our conjecture that the atypical sensory experiences of synesthetes represent a selective expression of a more diffuse propensity toward ‘typical’ crossmodality interactions.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945211001778","DOI":"10.1016/j.cortex.2011.06.008","ISSN":"0010-9452","author":[{"family":"Brang","given":"David"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Lisa E."},{"family":"Ramachandran","given":"Vilayanur S."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,5]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",5,8]]},"container-title-short":"Cortex"},

This enables distractor items to be created in which one of these features is ‘unbound’ with respect to the others (e.g. shape A + colour B + location A; shape A + colour A + location C). Synaesthetes had higher recognition rates suggesting an enhanced ability to bind certain visual features together into memory. Importantly, synaesthetes’ false alarm rates were lower only when colour was the unbound feature, not shape or location.

Early-learned words are higher in iconicity than later learned words. However, it remains unclear what role iconicity may play in actual language use. Here, we ask whether iconicity relates not just to the age at which words are acquired, but also to how frequently children and adults use the words in their speech. If iconicity serves to bootstrap word learning, then we would expect that children should say highly iconic words more frequently than less iconic words, especially early in development. We would also expect adults to use iconic words more often when speaking to children than to other adults. We examined the relationship between frequency and iconicity for approximately 2000 English words. Replicating previous findings, we found that more iconic words are learned earlier. Moreover, we found that more iconic words tend to be used more by younger children, and adults use more iconic words when speaking to children than to other adults. Together, our results show that young children not only learn words rated high in iconicity earlier than words low in iconicity, but they also produce these words more frequently in conversation – a pattern that is reciprocated by adults when speaking with children. Thus, the earliest conversations of children are relatively higher in iconicity, suggesting that this iconicity scaffolds the production and comprehension of spoken language during early development.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12572/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/desc.12572","ISSN":"1467-7687","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Perry","given":"Lynn K."},{"family":"Perlman","given":"Marcus"},{"family":"Winter","given":"Bodo"},{"family":"Massaro","given":"Dominic W."},{"family":"Lupyan","given":"Gary"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",5,22]]},"container-title-short":"Dev Sci"},

Gaps between turns in conversation are very short, meaning that listeners must begin planning their turn as soon as possible. While previous research has shown that paralinguistic features such as prosody and eye gaze provide cues to the pragmatic function of upcoming turns, we hypothesise that a systematic phonetic cue that marks interrogative words would also help early recognition of questions (allowing early preparation of answers), for instance wh-words sounding similar within a language. We analysed 226 languages from 66 different language families by means of permutation tests. We found that initial segments of wh-words were more similar within a language than between languages, also when controlling for language family, geographic area (stratified permutation) and analyzability (compound phrases excluded). Random samples tests revealed that initial segments of wh-words were more similar than initial segments of randomly selected word sets and conceptually related word sets (e.g., body parts, actions, pronouns). Finally, we hypothesised that this cue would be more useful at the beginning of a turn, so the similarity of the initial segment of wh-words should be greater in languages that place them at the beginning of a clause. We gathered typological data on 110 languages, and found the predicted trend, although statistical significance was not attained. While there may be several mechanisms that bring about this pattern (e.g., common derivation), we suggest that the ultimate explanation of the similarity of interrogative words is to facilitate early speech-act recognition. Importantly, this hypothesis can be tested empirically, and the current results provide a sound basis for future experimental tests.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037821661630577X","DOI":"10.1016/j.pragma.2017.04.004","ISSN":"0378-2166","author":[{"family":"Slonimska","given":"Anita"},{"family":"Roberts","given":"Seán G."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7]]},"title-short":"A case for systematic sound symbolism in pragmatics","container-title-short":"Journal of Pragmatics"},

The winner -- who received a monetary prize -- was judged by the ability of naive listeners to successfully infer the meanings of the created vocalizations. Among our participants were eight teams and individuals affiliated with prominent linguistics and language evolution programs in the US and Europe. We report the results from the contest, along with a series of experiments and analyses designed to assess how comprehensible the vocalizations are to naive listeners, as well as their iconicity and learnability as category labels.

The present study was designed to investigate whether different sets of acoustic cues predict size and shape symbolism, respectively. In two experiments, participants judged whether a given consonant-vowel speech sound was large or small, round or angular, using a size or shape scale. Visual size judgments were predicted by vowel formant F1 in combination with F2, and by vowel duration. Visual shape judgments were, however, predicted by formants F2 and F3. Size and shape symbolism were thus not induced by a common mechanism, but rather were distinctly affected by acoustic properties of speech sounds.

In the spoken modality, there is abundant evidence showing that iconicity is a key factor that facilitates language acquisition. However, when we look at sign languages, which excel in the prevalence of iconic structures, there is a more mixed picture, with some studies showing a positive effect and others showing a null or negative effect. In an attempt to reconcile the existing evidence the present review presents a critical overview of the literature on the acquisition of a sign language as first (L1) and second (L2) language and points at some factor that may be the source of disagreement. Regarding sign L1 acquisition, the contradicting findings may relate to iconicity being defined in a very broad sense when a more fine-grained operationalisation might reveal an effect in sign learning. Regarding sign L2 acquisition, evidence shows that there is a clear dissociation in the effect of iconicity in that it facilitates conceptual-semantic aspects of sign learning but hinders the acquisition of the exact phonological form of signs. It will be argued that when we consider the gradient nature of iconicity and that signs consist of a phonological form attached to a meaning we can discern how iconicity impacts sign learning in positive and negative ways.","URL":"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01280/full","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01280","ISSN":"1664-1078","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Ortega","given":"Gerardo"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"title-short":"Iconicity and Sign Lexical Acquisition","container-title-short":"Front.

Some of the best-known examples include the mil/mal effect (Sapir, Journal of Experimental Psychology, 12, 225–239, 1929) and the maluma/takete effect (Köhler, 1929). Interest in this topic has been on the rise within psychology, and studies have demonstrated that sound symbolic effects are relevant for many facets of cognition, including language, action, memory, and categorization. Sound symbolism also provides a mechanism by which words’ forms can have nonarbitrary, iconic relationships with their meanings. Although various proposals have been put forth for how phonetic features (both acoustic and articulatory) come to be associated with stimuli, there is as yet no generally agreed-upon explanation. We review five proposals: statistical co-occurrence between phonetic features and associated stimuli in the environment, a shared property among phonetic features and stimuli; neural factors; species-general, evolved associations; and patterns extracted from language. We identify a number of outstanding questions that need to be addressed on this topic and suggest next steps for the field.","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-017-1361-1","DOI":"10.3758/s13423-017-1361-1","ISSN":"1069-9384, 1531-5320","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Sidhu","given":"David M."},{"family":"Pexman","given":"Penny M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,24]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,28]]},"container-title-short":"Psychon Bull Rev"},

In 2 studies, 30-month-old children from preschools in Rosario, Argentina, were taught a new word applied to an unknown object using a picture book. The performance of the children was compared in 2 conditions: photographs and sketches, with varying levels of iconicity--the degree to which the image resembles the referent. Fisher's Exact Test revealed that, when learning with sketches, the word remained strongly associated with the printed picture, thus hampering access to its referent, the object. This was not the case when children learned the new word with photographs. The results show that perceptual similarity impacts on referential comprehension, with iconic pictures being more transparent representations at early ages. These findings may have implications for the design of educational books for young children.

To uncover what properties of the letters contribute to different scripts' ‘guessability,’ we analysed the visual spatial frequencies in each letter (Experiment 3). We predicted that the lower spectral frequencies in the formants of the vowel /u/ would pattern with lower spatial frequencies in the corresponding letters. Instead, we found that across all spatial frequencies, the letter with more black/white cycles (i.e. more ink) was more likely to be guessed as /u/, and the larger the difference between the glyphs in a pair, the higher the script's guessability.

Experiences of three different groups – self-reported voice synaesthetes, phoneticians and controls – were compared using both qualitative and quantitative analysis in a study conducted online. Whilst, in the qualitative analysis, synaesthetes used more colour and texture terms to describe voices than either phoneticians or controls, only weak differences, and many similarities, between groups were found in the quantitative analysis. Notable consistent results between groups were the matching of higher speech fundamental frequencies with lighter and redder colours, the matching of “whispery” voices with smoke-like textures and the matching of “harsh” and “creaky” voices with textures resembling dry cracked soil.

We review the increasing evidence for the role of semantic representations in the induction of synesthesia, and argue for the thesis that synesthetic abilities are developed and modified by semantic mechanisms. That is, in certain people semantic mechanisms associate concepts with perception-like experiences—and this association occurs in an extraordinary way. This phenomenon can be referred to as “higher” synesthesia or ideasthesia. The present analysis suggests that synesthesia develops during childhood and is being enriched further throughout the synesthetes’ lifetime; for example, the already existing concurrents may be adopted by novel inducers or new concurrents may be formed. For a deeper understanding of the origin and nature of synesthesia we propose to focus future research on two aspects: (i) the similarities between synesthesia and ordinary phenomenal experiences based on concepts; and (ii) the tight entanglement of perception, cognition and the conceptualization of the world. Importantly, an explanation of how biological systems get to generate experiences, synesthetic or not, may have to involve an explanation of how semantic networks are formed in general and what their role is in the ability to be aware of the surrounding world.","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4137691/","DOI":"10.3389/fnhum.2014.00509","ISSN":"1662-5161","author":[{"family":"Mroczko-Wąsowicz","given":"Aleksandra"},{"family":"Nikolić","given":"Danko"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,8,19]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,18]]},"PMID":"25191239","PMCID":"PMC4137691","container-title-short":"Front Hum Neurosci"},

To test this hypothesis, we presented vowel sounds synthesized by systematically manipulating the position of the tongue body’s center.

Results from the main experiment showed that lightness and chromaticity of matched colors exhibited systematic variations along the two axes of the position of the tongue body’s center. Some non-random associations between vowel sounds and colors remained effective with pitch and intensity of the sounds equalized in the control experiment, which suggests that other acoustic factors such as inherent pitch of vowels cannot solely account for the current results.

Using longitudinal video corpora, we compare the emergence of manual iconicity in hearing children who are learning a spoken language (co-speech gesture) to the emergence of manual iconicity in a deaf child who is creating a manual system of communication (homesign). We focus on one particular element of iconic gesture – the shape of the hand (handshape). We ask how handshape is used as an iconic resource in 1–5-year-olds, and how it relates to the semantic content of children’s communicative acts. We find that patterns of handshape development are broadly similar between co-speech gesture and homesign, suggesting that the building blocks underlying children&apos;s ability to iconically map manual forms to meaning are shared across different communicative systems: those where gesture is produced alongside speech, and those where gesture is the primary mode of communication.</p>","URL":"http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/lia.8.1.03car","DOI":"10.1075/lia.8.1.03car","ISSN":"1879-7865, 1879-7873","author":[{"family":"Cartmill","given":"Erica A."},{"family":"Rissman","given":"Lilia"},{"family":"Novack","given":"Miriam A."},{"family":"Goldin-Meadow","given":"Susan"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,2]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",10,7]]}},

Most sound symbolism studies have relied on a small stimulus set chosen to maximize the probability of finding an effect for a particular semantic category. Attempts to assign weights to sound symbolic cues have been limited by a methodology that has relied largely on forced contrast judgments, which do not allow systematic assignment of weights on the sound symbolic cues. We used a novel research approach designed to allow us to assign weights to sound symbolic cues. Participants made binary yes/no judgments about thousands of randomly-generated nonwords, deciding if they were good examples for each of 18 different semantic categories. Formal cues reliably predicted membership in several of those categories.

Contrary to the propositions of sound symbolism, participants in Experiment 1 did not consistently assign names with plosive consonant to objects with curved frames. Experiment 2, however, found that names with fricative consonants were more likely to be applied to materials with rough surfaces. The results suggested the existence of a direct relationship between speech sounds and their referent concepts that could be crucial in revealing the phenomenon of sound symbolism.

However, researchers have also suggested that low-level psychoacoustic features, such as auditory roughness, are important to dissonance perception. Similarly, cross-modal mapping has been shown to be unconscious, and we posit that roughness and consequently dissonance perception may be involved in cross-modal processing. We conducted two studies examining the effects of perceived dissonance and computed roughness on cross-modal percepts. In Study 1, we explored possible linkages between visual and auditory constructs. Participants (N = 20) rated eight auditory stimuli for dissonance, perceived shape (curvy to spiky), texture (rough to smooth) and hardness (hard to soft) on a continuous scale. Each stimulus consisted of a stringed or flute instrument playing a single note, at a standard pitch. A linear mixed-effects regression showed significant effects of perceptual dissonance on texture (p = .002) and shape (p = .03). We employed MacCullum’s (2006) computational model to estimate auditory roughness, but no significant effects were found, possibly due to the narrow range of roughness values in instrumental sounds. Thus, in Study 2, another set of eight stimuli were generated, with four predetermined levels of roughness: none (0), low (0.1), medium (0.5) and high (1.0), across two fundamental pitches (110Hz and 220Hz). Roughness was manipulated through the adjustment of modulation index and harmonicity in frequency-modulation synthesis. Participants (N = 41) rated each stimulus for dissonance and undertook a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task, matching an image from a pair of graphics depicting a spiky object (previously rated as rough and hard) and a curvy object (smooth and soft) to the auditory stimulus. Findings from a logistic mixed-effects regression suggests that auditory roughness has a stronger effect on the graphic choice, with higher roughness linked to the spikier graphics (p < .001). No significant effects were found for dissonance. In Study 1 participants rated each audio stimulus along a verbal descriptive dimension, and with the exception of round-spiky, most of these items were conventionally used metaphors in describing timbre. However, in Study 2, participants performed a 2AFC between two visual objects different on these dimensions, and tested a direct audio-visual correspondence being sound and sight. As the two tests showed different patterns of effects, future investigations will need to clarify what is the discrete contribution of sensation and language to the cross modal experience of sound.","author":[{"family":"Liew","given":"Kongmeng"},{"family":"Styles","given":"Suzy J."},{"family":"Lindborg","given":"PerMagnus"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"publisher-place":"Kyoto"},

However, the current standard method of ascertaining these differences through self-reported ratings of statements has been found to be unreliable. Here, we report a test–retest comparison of two sequentially presented questionnaires, asking participants to rate how well the depictions reflect their own experiences. The first questionnaire used standard rating statements, while the second presented the synaesthetic experience in a visual, illustrated format. Results from 12 female synaesthetes highlighted the test–retest consistency with the illustrated questionnaire to be significantly higher than statements alone, suggesting that the visual presentation more approximates and reflects the synaesthetic experience. Through doing so, the illustrated questionnaire is considered to enable an accurate and reliable partition of synaesthetes into projectors and associators.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945208001378","DOI":"10.1016/j.cortex.2008.02.006","ISSN":"0010-9452","author":[{"family":"Skelton","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Ludwig","given":"Casimir"},{"family":"Mohr","given":"Christine"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,6,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,28]]},"container-title-short":"Cortex"},

In English, for instance, pitches can be “high” or “low” (i.e., height-pitch association), whereas in other languages, pitches are described as “thin” or “thick” (i.e., thickness-pitch association). According to results from psychophysical studies, metaphors in language can shape people’s nonlinguistic space-pitch representations. But does language establish mappings between space and pitch in the first place, or does it only modify preexisting associations? To find out, we tested 4-month-old Dutch infants’ sensitivity to height-pitch and thickness-pitch mappings using a preferential-looking paradigm. The infants looked significantly longer at cross-modally congruent stimuli for both space-pitch mappings, which indicates that infants are sensitive to these associations before language acquisition. The early presence of space-pitch mappings means that these associations do not originate from language. Instead, language builds on preexisting mappings, changing them gradually via competitive associative learning. Space-pitch mappings that are language-specific in adults develop from mappings that may be universal in infants.","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797614528521","DOI":"10.1177/0956797614528521","ISSN":"0956-7976","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Dolscheid","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Hunnius","given":"Sabine"},{"family":"Casasanto","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Majid","given":"Asifa"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,6,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,7]]},"container-title-short":"Psychol Sci"},

These temporal relationships constitute an important metric for the nervous system when surmising which signals originate from common external events. Internal consistency is known to be aided by sensory adaptation: repeated exposure to consistent asynchrony brings perceived arrival times closer to simultaneity. However, given the diverse nature of our audiovisual environment, functionally useful adaptation would need to be constrained to signals that were generated together. In the current study, we investigate the role of two potential constraining factors: spatial and contextual correspondence. By employing an experimental design that allows independent control of both factors, we show that observers are able to simultaneously adapt to two opposing temporal relationships, provided they are segregated in space. No such recalibration was observed when spatial segregation was replaced by contextual stimulus features (in this case, pitch and spatial frequency). These effects provide support for dedicated asynchrony mechanisms that interact with spatially selective mechanisms early in visual and auditory sensory pathways.","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-012-3038-3","DOI":"10.1007/s00221-012-3038-3","ISSN":"0014-4819, 1432-1106","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Heron","given":"James"},{"family":"Roach","given":"Neil W."},{"family":"Hanson","given":"James V.

Here, we replicate and extend these findings through explicit matching of sounds of varying pitch to a range of tastes/flavors. In addition, participants in the experiment reported here also chose the type of musical instrument most appropriate for each taste/flavor. The association of sweet and sour tastes to high-pitched notes was confirmed. By contrast, umami and bitter tastes were preferentially matched to low-pitched notes. Flavors did not display such strong pitch associations. The choice of musical instrument seems to have been driven primarily by a matching of the hedonic value and familiarity of the two types of stimuli.
